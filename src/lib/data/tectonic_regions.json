This tectonically active margin is a result of the India and Australia plates converging with and subducting beneath the Sunda plate at a rate of approximately 50 to 70 mm\/yr. The main physiographic feature associated with this convergent margin is the Sunda-Java Trench, which stretches for 3,000 km parallel to the Java and Sumatra land masses and terminates at 120&deg; E. The convergence of the Indo-Australia and Sunda plates produces two active volcanic arcs: Sunda, which extends from 105 to 122&deg; E and Banda, which extends from 122 to 128&deg; E. The Sunda arc results solely from relatively simple oceanic plate subduction, while the Banda arc represents the transition from oceanic subduction to continental collision, where a complex, broad deforming zone is found. \n<\/p>\n<p>\nBased on modern activity, the Banda arc can be divided into three distinct zones: an inactive section, the Wetar Zone - bound by two active segments, the Flores Zone in the west and the Damar Zone in the east. The lack of volcanism in the Wetar Zone is attributed to the collision of Australia with the Sunda plate.  The gap in volcanic activity is underlain by a gap in intermediate depth seismicity, which is in contrast to nearly continuous deep seismicity below all three sections of the arc. The Flores Zone is characterized by down-dip compression in the subducted slab at intermediate depths and late Quaternary uplift of the forearc. These unusual features, along with GPS data interpretations, show that the Flores Zone marks the transition between subduction of oceanic crust in the west and the collision of continental crust in the east.  \n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe Java section of the Sunda arc is considered relatively aseismic historically when compared to the highly seismically active Sumatra section, despite both areas being located along the same active subduction margin. Shallow (0-20 km) events have occurred historically in the overlying Sunda plate, causing damage to local and regional communities. A recent example was the May 26, 2006 M6.3 left-lateral strike-slip event, which occurred at a depth of 10 km in central Java, and caused over 5,700 fatalities. Intermediate depth (70-300 km) earthquakes frequently occur beneath Java as a result of intraplate faulting within the Australia slab. Deep (300-650 km) earthquakes occur beneath the Java Sea and the back-arc region to the north of Java. Similar to other intermediate depth events these earthquakes are also associated with intraslab faulting. However, this subduction zone exhibits a gap in seismicity from 250-400 km, interpreted as the transition between extensional and compressional slab stresses. Historic examples of large intraplate events include: the 1903 M8.1 event, 1921 M7.5 event, 1977 M8.3 event, and August 2007 M7.5 event. \n<\/p>\n<p>\nLarge thrust earthquakes close to the Java trench are typically interplate faulting events along the slab interface between the Australia and Sunda plates. These earthquakes also generally have high tsunamigenic potential due to their shallow hypocentral depths. In some cases, these events have demonstrated slow moment-release, and have been defined as &lsquo;tsunami&rsquo; earthquakes, where rupture is large in the weak crustal layers very close to the seafloor. These events are categorized by tsunamis that are significantly larger than predicted by the earthquake\u2019s magnitude.  The most notable tsunami earthquakes in the Java region occurred on June 2, 1994 (M7.8) and July 17, 2006 (M7.7).  The 1994 event produced a tsunami with wave run-up heights of 13 m, killing over 200 people.  The 2006 event produced a tsunami of up to 15 m, and killed 730 people. While both of these tsunami earthquakes were characterized by rupture along thrust faults, they were followed by an abundance of normal faulting aftershocks.  These aftershocks are interpreted to result from extension within the subducting Australia plate, while the mainshocks represented interplate faulting between the Australia and Sunda plates.  \n<\/p>\n","type":"neic"}},{"type":"Feature","id":49,"geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[108.000000000101,-11.0000000003989],[87.9999999996013,-11.0000000003989],[87.9999999996013,16.5000000004006],[108.000000000101,16.5000000004006],[108.000000000101,-11.0000000003989]]]},"properties":{"name":"Sumatra Region","summary":"<h4>Seismotectonics of the Sumatra Region<\/h4>\n<a class=\"tectonic sumatra\" href=\"http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/earthquakes\/tectonic\/images\/sumatra_tsum.pdf\"><\/a>\n<p>\nThe plate boundary southwest of Sumatra is part of a long tectonic collision zone that extends over 8000 km from Papua in the east to the Himalayan front in the west. The Sumatra-Andaman portion of the collision zone forms a subduction zone megathrust plate boundary, the Sunda-Java trench, which accommodates convergence between the Indo-Australia and Sunda plates. This convergence is responsible for the intense seismicity and volcanism in Sumatra. The Sumatra Fault, a major transform structure that bisects Sumatra, accommodates the northwest-increasing lateral component of relative plate motion.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nRelative plate motion between the Indo-Australia and Sunda plates is rapid, decreasing from roughly 63 mm\/year near the southern tip of Sumatra (Australia relative to Sunda) to 44 mm\/year north of Andaman Islands (India relative to Sunda) and rotating counterclockwise to the northwest, so that relative motion near Jakarta is nearly trench-normal but becomes nearly trench-parallel near Myanmar. As a result of the rotation in relative motion along the strike of the arc and the interaction of multiple tectonic plates, several interrelated tectonic elements compose the Sumatra-Andaman plate boundary. Most strain accumulation and release occurs along the Sunda megathrust of the main subduction zone, where lithosphere of the subducting Indo-Australia plate is in contact with the overlying Sunda plate down to a depth of 60 km. Strain release associated with deformation within the subducting slab is evidenced by deeper earthquakes that extend to depths of less than 300 km on Sumatra and 150 km or less along the Andaman Islands. The increasingly oblique convergence between these two plates moving northwest along the arc is accommodated by crustal seismicity along a series of transform and normal faults. East of the Andaman Islands, back- arc spreading in the Andaman Sea produces a zone of distributed normal and strike-slip faulting. Similar to the Sumatran Fault, the Sagaing Fault near Myanmar also accommodates the strike-slip component of oblique plate motion. Plate-boundary related deformation is also not restricted to the subduction zone and overriding plate: the subducting Indo-Australian plate actually comprises two somewhat independent plates (India and Australia), with small amounts of motion relative to one another, that are joined along a broad, actively-deforming region producing seismicity up to several hundred kilometers west of the trench. This deformation is exemplified by the recent April 2012 earthquake sequence, which includes the April 11 M 8.6 and M 8.2 strike-slip events and their subsequent aftershocks.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nPaleoseismic studies using coral reefs as a proxy for relative land level changes associated with earthquake displacement suggest that the Sunda arc has repeatedly ruptured during relatively large events in the past, with records extending as far back as the 10th century. In northern Simeulue Island, the southern terminus of the 2004 megathrust earthquake rupture area, a cluster of megathrust earthquakes occurred over a 56 year period between A.D. 1390 and 1455, resulting in uplift substantially greater than that caused by the 2004 event. Studies that look at large sheeted deposits of sand on land interpreted as the transport of debris from a tsunami wave also indicate that this region has experienced significant tsunamis in the past centuries, albeit infrequently.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nPrior to 2004, the most recent megathrust earthquakes along the Sumatran-Andaman plate boundary were in 1797 (M 8.7-8.9), 1833 (M 8.9-9.1) and 1861 (M8.5). Since 2004, much of the Sunda megathrust between the northern Andaman Islands and Enggano Island, a distance of more than 2,000 km, has ruptured in a series of large subduction zone earthquakes - most rupturing the plate boundary south of Banda Aceh. The great M 9.1 earthquake of December 26, 2004, which produced a devastating tsunami, ruptured much of the boundary between Myanmar and Simeulue Island offshore Banda Aceh. Immediately to the south of the great 2004 earthquake, the M 8.6 Nias Island earthquake of March 28, 2005 ruptured a 400-km section between Simeulue and the Batu Islands. Farther south in the Mentawai islands, two earthquakes on September 12, 2007 of M 8.5 and M 7.9 occurred in the southern portion of the estimated 1797 and 1833 ruptures zone, which extends from approximately Enggano Island to the northern portion of Siberut Island. Smaller earthquakes have also been locally important: a M 7.6 rupture within the subducting plate caused considerable damage in Padang in 2009, and a M 7.8 rupture on October 25, 2010 occurred on the shallow portion of the megathrust to the west of the Mentawai Islands, and caused a substantial tsunami on the west coast of those islands.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nIn addition to the current seismic hazards along this portion of the Sunda arc, this region is also recognized as having one of the highest volcanic hazards in the world. One of the most dramatic eruptions in human history was the Krakatau eruption on August 26-27, 1883, a volcano just to the southeast of the island of Sumatra, which resulted in over 35, 000 casualties.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nSubduction and seismicity along the plate boundary adjacent to Java is fundamentally different from that of the Sumatran-Andaman section. Relative motion along the Java arc is trench-normal\n(approximately 65-70 mm\/year) and does not exhibit the same strain partitioning and back-arc strike- slip faulting that are observed along the Sumatra margin. Neither has the Java subduction zone hosted similar large magnitude megathrust events to those of its neighbor, at least in documented history. Although this region is not as seismically active as the Sumatra region, the Java arc has hosted low to intermediate-magnitude extensional earthquakes and deep-focus (300-700 km) events and exhibits a similar if not higher volcanic hazard. This arc has also hosted two large, shallow tsunami earthquakes in the recent past which resulted in high tsunami run-ups along the southern Java coast.\n<\/p>\n","type":"neic"}},{"type":"Feature","id":48,"geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[170.000000000301,-9.99999999969941],[163.999999999701,-9.99999999969941],[163.999999999701,-12.0000000001991],[126.999999999901,-12.0000000001991],[126.999999999901,-3.9999999999992],[114.999999999601,-3.9999999999992],[114.999999999601,1.99999999970106],[170.000000000301,1.99999999970106],[170.000000000301,-9.99999999969941]]]},"properties":{"name":"New Guinea Region and Vicinity","summary":"<h4>Seismotectonics of the New Guinea Region and Vicinity<\/h4>\n<a class=\"tectonic newguinea\" href=\"http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/earthquakes\/tectonic\/images\/newguinea_tsum.pdf\"><\/a>\n<p>\nThe Australia-Pacific plate boundary is over 4000 km long on the \nnorthern margin, from the Sunda (Java) trench in the west to the \nSolomon Islands in the east. The eastern section is over 2300 km \nlong, extending west from northeast of the Australian continent \nand the Coral Sea until it intersects the east coast of Papua New \nGuinea. The boundary is dominated by the general northward subduction \nof the Australia plate.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nAlong the South Solomon trench, the Australia plate converges with \nthe Pacific plate at a rate of approximately 95 mm\/yr towards the \neast-northeast. Seismicity along the trench is dominantly related \nto subduction tectonics and large earthquakes are common: there have \nbeen 13 M7.5+ earthquakes recorded since 1900. On April 1, 2007, a \nM8.1 interplate megathrust earthquake occurred at the western end of \nthe trench, generating a tsunami and killing at least 40 people. This \nwas the third M8.1 megathrust event associated with this subduction \nzone in the past century; the other two occurred in 1939 and 1977.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nFurther east at the New Britain trench, the relative motions of several \nmicroplates surrounding the Australia-Pacific boundary, including \nnorth-south oriented seafloor spreading in the Woodlark Basin south \nof the Solomon Islands, maintain the general northward subduction of \nAustralia-affiliated lithosphere beneath Pacific-affiliated lithosphere. \nMost of the large and great earthquakes east of New Guinea are related \nto this subduction; such earthquakes are particularly concentrated at \nthe cusp of the trench south of New Ireland. 33 M7.5+ earthquakes have \nbeen recorded since 1900, including three shallow thrust fault M8.1 \nevents in 1906, 1919, and 2007.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe western end of the Australia-Pacific plate boundary is perhaps the \nmost complex portion of this boundary, extending 2000 km from Indonesia \nand the Banda Sea to eastern New Guinea. The boundary is dominantly \nconvergent along an arc-continent collision segment spanning the width \nof New Guinea, but the regions near the edges of the impinging Australia \ncontinental margin also include relatively short segments of extensional, \nstrike-slip and convergent deformation. The dominant convergence is \naccommodated by shortening and uplift across a 250-350 km-wide band of \nnorthern New Guinea, as well as by slow southward-verging subduction of \nthe Pacific plate north of New Guinea at the New Guinea trench. Here, \nthe Australia-Pacific plate relative velocity is approximately 110 mm\/yr \ntowards the northeast, leading to the 2-8 mm\/yr uplift of the New Guinea \nHighlands. \n<\/p>\n<p>\nWhereas the northern band of deformation is relatively diffuse east of the \nIndonesia-Papua New Guinea border, in western New Guinea there are at least \ntwo small (&lt;100,000 km&sup2;) blocks of relatively undeformed lithosphere. The \nwesternmost of these is the Birds Head Peninsula microplate in Indonesia's \nWest Papua province, bounded on the south by the Seram trench. The Seram \ntrench was originally interpreted as an extreme bend in the Sunda subduction \nzone, but is now thought to represent a southward-verging subduction zone \nbetween Birds Head and the Banda Sea. \n<\/p>\n<p>\nThere have been 22 M7.5+ earthquakes recorded in the New Guinea region since \n1900. The dominant earthquake mechanisms are thrust and strike slip, associated \nwith the arc-continent collision and the relative motions between numerous \nlocal microplates. The largest earthquake in the region was a M8.2 shallow \nthrust fault event in the northern Papua province of Indonesia that killed \n166 people in 1996.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe western portion of the northern Australia plate boundary extends \napproximately 4800 km from New Guinea to Sumatra and primarily separates \nAustralia from the Eurasia plate, including the Sunda block. This portion \nis dominantly convergent and includes subduction at the Sunda (Java) trench, \nand a young arc-continent collision.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nIn the east, this boundary extends from the Kai Islands to Sumba along the \nTimor trough, offset from the Sunda trench by 250 km south of Sumba. \nContrary to earlier tectonic models in which this trough was interpreted \nas a subduction feature continuous with the Sunda subduction zone, it is \nnow thought to represent a subsiding deformational feature related to the \ncollision of the Australia plate continental margin and the volcanic arc \nof the Eurasia plate, initiating in the last 5-8 Myr. Before collision began, \nthe Sunda subduction zone extended eastward to at least the Kai Islands, \nevidenced by the presence of a northward-dipping zone of seismicity beneath \nTimor Leste. A more detailed examination of the seismic zone along it's \neastern segment reveals a gap in intermediate depth seismicity under Timor \nand seismic mechanisms that indicate an eastward propagating tear in the \ndescending slab as the negatively buoyant oceanic lithosphere detaches from \npositively buoyant continental lithosphere. On the surface, GPS measurements \nindicate that the region around Timor is currently no longer connected to the \nEurasia plate, but instead is moving at nearly the same velocity as the \nAustralia plate, another consequence of collision.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nLarge earthquakes in eastern Indonesia occur frequently but interplate megathrust \nevents related to subduction are rare; this is likely due to the disconnection \nof the descending oceanic slab from the continental margin. There have been 9 \nM7.5+ earthquakes recorded from the Kai Islands to Sumba since 1900.

The Philippine Sea plate is unusual \nin that its borders are nearly all zones of plate convergence.  The Pacific \nplate is subducted into the mantle, south of Japan, beneath the \nIzu-Bonin and Mariana island arcs, which extend more than 3,000 km along \nthe eastern margin of the Philippine Sea plate. This subduction zone is \ncharacterized by rapid plate convergence and high-level seismicity extending \nto depths of over 600 km.  In spite of this extensive zone of plate \nconvergence, the plate interface has been associated with few great \n(M&gt;8.0) &lsquo;megathrust&rsquo; earthquakes. This low seismic energy release is thought \nto result from weak coupling along the plate interface \n(Scholz and Campos, 1995).  These convergent plate margins are also \nassociated with unusual zones of back-arc extension (along with resulting \nseismic activity) that decouple the volcanic island arcs from the remainder of \nthe Philippine Sea Plate (Karig et al., 1978; Klaus et al., 1992).  \n<\/p>  \n<p>\nSouth of the Mariana arc, the Pacific plate is subducted beneath the Yap \nIslands along the Yap trench. The long zone of Pacific plate subduction at \nthe eastern margin of the Philippine Sea Plate is responsible for the generation \nof the deep Izu-Bonin, Mariana, and Yap trenches as well as parallel chains of \nislands and volcanoes, typical of circum-pacific island arcs. Similarly, the \nnorthwestern margin of the Philippine Sea plate is subducting beneath the \nEurasia plate along a convergent zone, extending from southern Honshu to \nthe northeastern coast of Taiwan, manifested by the Ryukyu Islands and the \nNansei-Shoto (Ryukyu) trench. The Ryukyu Subduction Zone is associated with \na similar zone of back-arc extension, the Okinawa Trough. At Taiwan, the plate \nboundary is characterized by a zone of arc-continent collision, whereby the \nnorthern end of the Luzon island arc is colliding with the buoyant crust of the \nEurasia continental margin offshore China.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nAlong its western margin, the Philippine Sea plate is associated with a zone of \noblique convergence with the Sunda Plate. This highly active convergent plate \nboundary extends along both sides the Philippine Islands, from Luzon in the \nnorth to the Celebes Islands in the south. The tectonic setting of the Philippines \nis unusual in several respects: it is characterized by opposite-facing subduction \nsystems on its east and west sides; the archipelago is cut by a major transform \nfault, the Philippine Fault; and the arc complex itself is marked by active volcanism, \nfaulting, and high seismic activity.  Subduction of the Philippine Sea Plate occurs at \nthe eastern margin of the archipelago along the Philippine Trench and its northern \nextension, the East Luzon Trough. The East Luzon Trough is thought to be an \nunusual example of a subduction zone in the process of formation, as the Philippine \nTrench system gradually extends northward (Hamburger et al., 1983). On the west \nside of Luzon, the Sunda Plate subducts eastward along a series of trenches, \nincluding the Manila Trench in the north, the smaller less well-developed Negros \nTrench in the central Philippines, and the Sulu and Cotabato trenches in the south \n(Cardwell et al., 1980). At its northern and southern terminations, subduction at \nthe Manila Trench is interrupted by arc-continent collision, between the northern \nPhilippine arc and the Eurasian continental margin at Taiwan and between the \nSulu-Borneo Block and Luzon at the island of Mindoro. The Philippine fault, which \nextends over 1,200 km within the Philippine arc, is seismically active. The fault has \nbeen associated with major historical earthquakes, including the destructive M7.6 \nLuzon earthquake of 1990 (Yoshida and Abe, 1992).  A number of other active\n intra-arc fault systems are associated with high seismic activity, including the \nCotabato Fault and the Verde Passage-Sibuyan Sea Fault (Galgana et al., 2007).\n<\/p>\n<p>\nRelative plate motion vectors near the Philippines (about 80 mm\/yr) is oblique to the \nplate boundary along the two plate margins of central Luzon, where it is partitioned \ninto orthogonal plate convergence along the trenches and nearly pure translational \nmotion along the Philippine Fault (Barrier et al., 1991).  Profiles B and C reveal \nevidence of opposing inclined seismic zones at intermediate depths (roughly 70-300 km) \nand complex tectonics at the surface along the Philippine Fault.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nSeveral relevant tectonic elements, plate boundaries and active volcanoes, provide a \ncontext for the seismicity presented on the main map.  The plate boundaries are most \naccurate along the axis of the trenches and more diffuse or speculative in the South \nChina Sea and Lesser Sunda Islands.  The active volcanic arcs (Siebert and Simkin, 2002) \nfollow the Izu, Volcano, Mariana, and Ryukyu island chains and the main Philippine islands \nparallel to the Manila, Negros, Cotabato, and Philippine trenches.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nSeismic activity along the boundaries of the Philippine Sea Plate (Allen et al., 2009) has \nproduced 7 great (M&gt;8.0) earthquakes and 250 large (M&gt;7) events.

Some authors divide the edges of these plates into several microplates that together take up the overall relative motions between the larger tectonic blocks, including the Okhotsk microplate in northern Japan, the Okinawa microplate in southern Japan, the Yangzee microplate in the area of the East China Sea, and the Amur microplate in the area of the Sea of Japan.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe seafloor expression of the boundary between the Pacific and North America plates lies 300 km off the east coasts of Hokkaido and Honshu at the Kuril-Kamchatka and Japan trenches. The subduction of the Pacific plate beneath the North America plate, at rates of 83-90 mm\/yr, generates abundant seismicity, predominantly as a result of interplate slip along the interface between the plates. The 1958 M 8.4 Etorofu, 1963 M 8.6 Kuril, 2003 M 8.3 Tokachi-Oki, and the 2011 M 9.0 Tohoku earthquakes all exemplify such megathrust seismicity. The 1933 M 8.4 Sanriku-Oki earthquake and the 1994 M 8.3 Shikotan earthquake are examples of intraplate seismicity, caused by deformation within the lithosphere of the subducting Pacific plate (Sanriku-Oki) and of the overriding North America plate (Shikotan), respectively.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nAt the southern terminus of the Japan Trench the intersection of the Pacific, North America, and Philippine Sea plates forms the Boso Triple Junction, the only example of a trench-trench-trench intersection in the world. South of the triple junction the Pacific plate subducts beneath the Philippine Sea plate at the Izu-Ogasawara trench, at rates of 45-56 mm\/yr. This margin is noteworthy because of the steep dip of the subducting Pacific plate (70&deg; or greater below depths of 50 km depth), and because of its heterogeneous seismicity; few earthquakes above M 7 occur at shallow depths, yet many occur below 400 km.  The lack of large shallow megathrust earthquakes may be a result of weak coupling at the plate interface, or simply a reflection of an incomplete earthquake catalog with respect to the length of typical seismic cycles.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe northernmost section of the Philippine Sea plate shares a 350 km boundary with the North America plate that runs approximately east-west from the Boso Triple Junction towards the Izu Peninsula. This short boundary is dominated by the subduction of the Philippine Sea plate beneath Japan along the Sagami Trough, but also includes small sections of transform motion.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe subduction of the Philippine Sea plate under the Eurasia plate begins at the Suruga Trough, immediately southwest of the Izu peninsula.  In the northern To&#772;kai, Tonankai and Nankai sections of this subduction zone, historical data indicate M 8+ earthquake recurrence intervals of 100-150 years. The Tonankai and Nankai sections last ruptured in M 8.1 earthquakes in 1944 and 1946, respectively, while the To&#772;kai section last broke in 1854. In the 1980's studies began to forecast the imminence of a large earthquake in the To&#772;kai region, and warned of its potential impact on the cities of Tokyo and Yokohama (the two largest cities in Japan); to date, the expected event has not occurred.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe boundary between the Philippine Sea and Eurasia plates continues south and southwestwards from the Suruga Trough, extending 2000 km along the Nankai and Ryukyu trenches before reaching the island of Taiwan. Along the Ryukyu Trench, the Philippine Sea plate exhibits trench normal subduction at rates increasing from 48 mm\/yr in the northeast to 65 mm\/yr in the southwest. Convergence and the associated back-arc deformation west of the oceanic trench creates the Ryukyu Islands and the Okinawa Trough. The largest historic event observed along this subduction zone was the M 8.1 Kikai Island earthquake in 1911.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nIn the vicinity of Taiwan the structure of the Philippine Sea: Eurasia plate boundary and the associated pattern of seismicity becomes more complex. 400 km east of Taiwan a clockwise rotation in the trend of the margin (from NE-SW to E-W), paired with an increase in subduction obliquity creates a section of the plate boundary that exhibits dextral transform and oblique thrusting motions. South of Taiwan the polarity of subduction flips; the Eurasia plate subducts beneath the Philippine Sea plate. Debate surrounds contrasting models of the plate boundary position between the zones of oppositely verging subduction, and the boundary's relation to patterns of seismicity. Many studies propose that crustal thickening causes the majority of regional seismicity, while others attribute seismicity to deformation associated with subduction. Another resolution proposes a tear in the Philippine Sea plate and a complex assortment of subduction, transform, and collisional motion. All the models concede that seismicity around the island of Taiwan is anomalously shallow, with few earthquakes deeper than 70km.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nWhile there are no instances of an earthquake M&gt;8 in the modern record, Taiwan and its surrounding region have experienced eight M&gt;7.5 events between 1900 and 2014. The dominance of shallow M&lt;8 earthquakes suggests fairly weak plate boundary coupling, with most earthquakes caused by internal plate deformation. The 1935 M 7.1 Hsinchu-Taichung earthquake and the 1999 M 7.6 Chi-Chi Earthquake both exemplify the shallow continental crust thrust faulting that dominates regional seismicity across the island. A major tectonic feature of the island is the Longitudinal Valley Fault, which ruptures frequently in small, shallow earthquakes. In 1951, the Longitudinal Valley Fault hosted twelve M&ge;6 events known as the Hualien-Taitung earthquake sequence.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nLarge earthquakes in the vicinity of Japan and Taiwan have been both destructive and deadly. The regions high population density makes shallow earthquakes especially dangerous. Since 1900 there have been 13 earthquakes (9 in Japan, 4 in Taiwan) that have each caused over 1000 fatalities, leading to a total of nearly 200,000 earthquake related deaths. In January 1995 an earthquake that ruptured a southern branch of the Japan Median Tectonic Line near the city of Kobe (population 1.5 million) killed over 5000 people. The 1923 Kanto earthquake shook both Yokohama (population 500,000, at that time) and Tokyo (population 2.1 million), killing 142,000 people. The earthquake also started fires that burned down 90&#37; of the buildings in Yokohama and 40&#37; of the buildings in Tokyo. Most recently, the M9.0 Tohoku earthquake, which ruptured a 400 km stretch of the subduction zone plate boundary east of Honshu, and the tsunami it generated caused over 20,000 fatalities.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/of\/2010\/1083\/d\/\" target=\"_blank\"> \nMore information on regional seismicity and tectonics<\/a>\n<\/p>","type":"neic"}},{"type":"Feature","id":31,"geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-78.5918121343219,36.8298988340649],[-79.5060653680217,37.3163528442093],[-79.208023071307,38.3887672417158],[-77.6261825557797,38.3119010928621],[-77.1537323002048,38.1670494079048],[-77.1688842776866,37.0057449347818],[-77.1695709226593,37.0026435858337],[-77.1717300420072,37.0029220582073],[-78.5918121343219,36.8298988340649]]]},"properties":{"name":"Central Virginia Seismic Zone","summary":"<h4>Earthquakes in the Central Virginia Seismic Zone<\/h4>\n<p>\nSince at least 1774, people in central Virginia have felt small earthquakes and suffered \ndamage from infrequent larger ones.

in the Stable Continental Region<\/h4>\n\n<h4>Natural Occurring Earthquake Activity<\/h4>\n\n<p>\nMost of North America east of the Rocky Mountains has infrequent earthquakes. Here and there earthquakes are more numerous, for example in the New Madrid seismic zone centered on southeastern Missouri, in the Charlevoix-Kamouraska seismic zone of eastern Quebec, in New England, in the New York - Philadelphia - Wilmington urban corridor, and elsewhere. However, most of the enormous region from the Rockies to the Atlantic can go years without an earthquake large enough to be felt, and several U.S. states have never reported a damaging earthquake.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nEarthquakes east of the Rocky Mountains, although less frequent than in the West, are typically felt over a much broader region than earthquakes of similar magnitude in the west. East of the Rockies, an earthquake can be felt over an area more than ten times larger than a similar magnitude earthquake on the west coast. It would not be unusual for a magnitude 4.0 earthquake in eastern or central North America to be felt by a significant percentage of the population in many communities more than 100 km (60 mi) from its source. A magnitude 5.5 earthquake in eastern or central North America might be felt by much of the population out to more than 500 km (300 mi) from its source. Earthquakes east of the Rockies that are centered in populated areas and large enough to cause damage are, similarly, likely to cause damage out to greater distances than earthquakes of the same magnitude centered in western North America.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nMost earthquakes in North America east of the Rockies occur as faulting within bedrock, usually miles deep.   Few earthquakes east of the Rockies, however, have been definitely linked to mapped geologic faults, in contrast to the situation at plate boundaries such as California's San Andreas fault system, where scientists can commonly use  geologic evidence to identify a fault that has produced a large earthquake and that is likely  to produce large future earthquakes.  Scientists who study eastern and central North America earthquakes often work from the hypothesis that modern earthquakes occur as the result of slip on preexisting faults that were formed in earlier geologic eras and that have been reactivated under the current stress conditions. The bedrock of Eastern North America is, however, laced with faults that were active in earlier geologic eras, and few of these faults are known to have been active in the current geologic era.  In most areas east of the Rockies, the likelihood of future damaging earthquakes is currently estimated from the frequencies and sizes of instrumentally recorded earthquakes or earthquakes documented in historical records.\n<\/p>\n\n<h4>Induced Seismicity<\/h4>\n<p>\nAs is the case elsewhere in the world, there is evidence that some  central and eastern North America earthquakes have been triggered or caused  by human activities that have altered  the stress conditions in earth's crust sufficiently to induce faulting.   Activities that have induced felt earthquakes in some geologic environments have included impoundment of water behind dams, injection of fluid into the earth's crust, extraction of fluid or gas, and removal of rock in mining or quarrying operations.  In much of eastern and central North America, the number of earthquakes suspected of having been induced is much smaller than the number of natural earthquakes, but in some regions, such as the south-central states of the U.S., a significant majority of recent earthquakes are thought by many seismologists to have been human-induced.  Even within areas with many human-induced earthquakes, however, the activity that seems to induce seismicity at one location may be taking place at many other locations without inducing felt earthquakes.  In addition, regions with frequent induced earthquakes may also be subject to damaging earthquakes that would have occurred independently of human activity.  Making a strong scientific case for a causative link between a particular human activity and a particular sequence of earthquakes typically involves special studies devoted specifically to the question.  Such investigations usually address the process by which the suspected triggering activity might have significantly altered stresses in the bedrock at the earthquake source, and they commonly address the ways in which the characteristics of the suspected human-triggered earthquakes differ from the characteristics of natural earthquakes in the region.\n<\/p>\n<!--\n SCR.doc, 07\/23\/03, Page 1 of 1\n -->","type":"neic"}},{"type":"Feature","id":50,"geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-147.778958105632,64.3097038289695],[-144.299125335765,64.1123515557806],[-139.217023843975,63.3722396877124],[-137.687459317293,62.7308094025328],[-134.529648681041,60.7078369641056],[-131.643212396834,58.6601941290568],[-128.337379387148,54.8856236033475],[-126.166384575287,52.5419360223305],[-124.686160839151,50.1982484413135],[-132.03793872659,49.5814885509568],[-135.072397384231,52.3692432531745],[-138.08218564615,53.9234781755783],[-140.623236392945,55.2556795373817],[-142.670879227094,56.0204618011721],[-143.731706236853,56.1438137788837],[-145.160656471918,56.0885243471218],[-144.379744552469,59.7122668205583],[-144.352340871533,59.9576280530931],[-144.328637264997,60.2483152057831],[-144.710785649638,60.5813219673359],[-145.305803981668,60.9469356416675],[-146.001186851891,61.2265225684627],[-147.055014500219,61.4272516439491],[-147.750397370442,61.4344205401767],[-147.756063110124,61.5623043869389],[-147.778958105632,64.3097038289695]]]},"properties":{"name":"Offshore British Columbia-Southeastern Alaska and Vicinity","summary":"<h4>Seismotectonics of Offshore British Columbia-Southeastern Alaska and Vicinity<\/h4>\n<a class=\"tectonic qcf\" href=\"http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/earthquakes\/tectonic\/images\/qcf_tsum.pdf\"><\/a>\n\n<p>\nThe tectonics of the Pacific margin of North America between Vancouver Island and south-central Alaska are dominated by the northwest motion of the Pacific plate with respect to the North America plate at a velocity of approximately 50 mm\/yr. In the south of this mapped region, convergence between the northern extent of the Juan de Fuca plate (also known as the Explorer microplate) and North America plate dominate. North from the Explorer, Pacific, and North America plate triple junction, Pacific:North America motion is accommodated along the ~650-km-long Queen Charlotte fault system. Offshore of Haida Gwaii and to the southwest, the obliquity of the Pacific:North America plate motion vector creates a transpressional regime, and a complex mixture of strike-slip and convergent (underthrusting) tectonics. North of the Haida Gwaii islands, plate motion is roughly parallel to the plate boundary, resulting in almost pure dextral strike-slip motion along the Queen Charlotte fault. To the north, the Queen Charlotte fault splits into multiple structures, continuing offshore of southeastern Alaska as the Fairweather fault, and branching east into the Chatham Strait and Denali faults through the interior of Alaska. The plate boundary north and west of the Fairweather fault ultimately continues as the Alaska-Aleutians subduction zone, where Pacific plate lithosphere subducts beneath the North America plate at the Aleutians Trench. The transition is complex, and involves intraplate structures such as the Transition fault. The Pacific margin offshore British Columbia is one of the most active seismic zones in North America and has hosted a number of large earthquakes historically.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nAt the southern extent of the mapped region offshore of Vancouver Island lies a complex triple junction between the Pacific, North America, and Juan de Fuca plates (which includes the Explorer and Winona microplates). The Winona microplate experiences little relative motion with respect to North America. Similarly, at its northern extent the Explorer microplate tracks North America plate motion, but is subducting at a rate of 2 cm\/yr near its southern extent adjacent to the Nootka Fault. Farther south the main body of the oceanic Juan de Fuca plate converges with and subducts beneath the continental North America plate at a rate of 4.0\u20134.5 cm\/yr. The Explorer microplate is heavily deformed by internal dextral faulting, experiencing frequent moderate-sized earthquakes. During the period from 1973 to 2013, this ~30-km-wide area experienced close to 50 earthquakes of M 5 or greater. The largest of these was a M 6.7 event that occurred on April 6, 1992. On January 5, 2008, M 6.6 and M 6.4 earthquakes struck in this same region just 40 minutes apart, and were separated by less than 20 km along a SE\/NW trend that is sub-parallel to the motion of the Pacific plate. Like many other similar events in the region, no damage or casualties were reported for these earthquakes.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nThe Queen Charlotte fault trends northwestward from the triple junction region, accommodating approximately 5.5 cm\/yr of dextral strike-slip motion along the Pacific:North America plate boundary. The majority of earthquakes associated with the Queen Charlotte fault are purely dextral strike-slip in nature, though occasional earthquakes exhibit a significant thrust component, such as the 1970 M 6.8 event and the 2012 M 7.8 event. Because the Pacific:North America plate motion vector adjacent to the islands of Haida Gwaii is oblique to the plate boundary, the Pacific plate underthrusts the Queen Charlotte terrace and the western margin of the North America plate. The convergent component of the plate vector is accommodated by relative motion between the Pacific plate and the Queen Charlotte terrace, though it is unclear from geophysical evidence how far the Pacific plate extends beneath the North America plate.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nThe largest earthquake observed along the Queen Charlotte fault was a M 8.0 strike-slip event in 1949, located ~25 km west of the north tip of Haida Gwaii. This earthquake created a minor far-field tsunami, an uncommon occurrence for strike-slip faulting. The 1970 M 6.8 earthquake that ruptured ~30 km south of the southern tip of Haida Gwaii was one of the first large magnitude events in the area to be recognized as having a significant thrust component. More recently the M 7.8 Haida Gwaii earthquake struck adjacent to the south-central portion of the islands on October 28, 2012, and was characterized by oblique thrust faulting, triggering a locally significant tsunami. Only four months later on January 5, 2013, a large strike-slip earthquake (M 7.5) occurred a few hundred kilometers farther north, near the junction of the Fairweather and Queen Charlotte faults. No major structural damage or casualties were reported for either of these recent events.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nContinuing north, dextral Queen Charlotte fault motion extends into the Fairweather fault and other inland structures such as the Chatham Strait and Denali faults. The Fairweather fault is a continuation of the Queen Charlotte fault that eventually dies out as it comes onshore into Alaska. The average slip rate of the Fairweather fault is believed to be 4.6 \u00b1 2.0 cm\/yr, oriented northwestward. On July 9, 1958, the Fairweather fault experienced its largest documented earth-quake, a M 7.8 event that caused a massive landslide and subsequent water wave in Lituya Bay. The wave caused by the landslide stripped away trees and ground soil up to a height of 520 m, and caused five fatalities.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nThe Chatham Strait fault trends north-northwest from its origin at the Queen Charlotte fault and Fairweather fault junction. This structure does not appear to be accommodating a significant fraction of plate motion and has not hosted any significant historic seismic activity. Farther north the Chatham Strait fault turns northwestward, transitioning into the Denali fault, which continues through continental North America. The Denali fault had been relatively quiet historically until the 2002 earthquake sequence, when a M 6.6 event was followed 11 days later by a M 7.8 earthquake that ruptured an ~340 km section of the fault system on November 3rd of that year. Despite the large size of the November event, its remote location meant only a small amount of structural damage was observed, with no fatalities and few injuries reported. For three decades prior to the 2002 event, seismicity along the Denali fault was characterized by an average of four M = 3 events per year. However, in the eight months leading up to\nthe mainshock, microseismicity along the Denali fault increased significantly, and 80 small events were recorded.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nNear the northern termination of the Fairweather fault, the west-northwest trending Transition fault marks the boundary between the Yakutat terrane and Pacific plate. The Yakutat terrane is a 15- to 30-km-thick igneous plateau that began to subduct at a low angle beneath continental North America 30 to 35 million years ago. Though the Yakutat terrane subducts at a slightly slower rate than that of the Pacific plate, its convergence direction has a slightly more westerly trend, causing compressional deformation along the Transition fault to increase towards the northwest. Extending southward from the Transition fault, the Gulf of Alaska shear zone has experienced a high rate of seismicity historically, with earthquakes reaching M  > 7.0. The Gulf of Alaska shear zone is believed to have formed along an old fracture zone or spreading fabric in the oceanic crust, and is an example of intraplate seismicity reflecting high stresses generated by nearby plate boundary processes, in this case immediately to the north , between the Yakutat terrane and Pacific plate. The Gulf of Alaska shear zone hosted a sequence of large earthquakes between 1987 and 1992, consisting of five events of M 6.8 or larger (three of which were M 7.8, M 7.9, and M 7.9).\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nWithin the greater Queen Charlotte fault region (excluding the Alaska-Aleutians subduction zone), more than 150 earthquakes of M 5 or greater have occurred between 1973 and 2013, with only a small fraction of these events rupturing at depths greater than 25 km and none deeper than 35 km. Earthquake epicenters along the Queen Charlotte fault express an east-west asymmetry, with the majority of seismicity occurring toward the eastern slope of the marine terrace near the definition of the Queen Charlotte fault trace. This can be explained by an east-dipping fault plane, evident in moment tensor data for moderate-to-large earthquakes within the transform fault zone.\n<\/p>","type":"neic"}},{"type":"Feature","id":39,"geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-59.9999999995996,-44.9999999998993],[-89.9999999998994,-44.9999999998993],[-89.9999999998994,4.50000000010073],[-77.3000000000993,4.50000000010073],[-71.9999999998994,4.50000000010073],[-59.9999999995996,4.50000000010073],[-59.9999999995996,-44.9999999998993]]]},"properties":{"name":"South America","summary":"<h4>Seismotectonics of South America (Nazca Plate Region)<\/h4>\n<a class=\"tectonic southamerica\" href=\"http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/earthquakes\/tectonic\/images\/southamerica_tsum.pdf\"><\/a>\n<p>\nThe South American arc extends over 7,000 km, from the Chilean margin \ntriple junction offshore of southern Chile to its intersection with the Panama \nfracture zone, offshore of the southern coast of Panama in Central America. \nIt marks the plate boundary between the subducting Nazca plate and the \nSouth America plate, where the oceanic crust and lithosphere of the Nazca \nplate begin their descent into the mantle beneath South America. The \nconvergence associated with this subduction process is responsible for the \nuplift of the Andes Mountains, and for the active volcanic chain present along \nmuch of this deformation front. Relative to a fixed South America plate, the \nNazca plate moves slightly north of eastwards at a rate varying from \napproximately 80 mm\/yr in the south to approximately 65 mm\/yr in the north.  \nAlthough the rate of subduction varies little along the entire arc, there are \ncomplex changes in the geologic processes along the subduction zone that \ndramatically influence volcanic activity, crustal deformation, earthquake \ngeneration and occurrence all along the western edge of South America.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nMost of the large earthquakes in South America are constrained to shallow \ndepths of 0 to 70 km resulting from both crustal and interplate deformation. \nCrustal earthquakes result from deformation and mountain building in the \noverriding South America plate and generate earthquakes as deep as \napproximately 50 km. Interplate earthquakes occur due to slip along the \ndipping interface between the Nazca and the South American plates. \nInterplate earthquakes in this region are frequent and often large, and occur \nbetween the depths of approximately 10 and 60 km.  Since 1900, numerous \nmagnitude 8 or larger earthquakes have occurred on this subduction zone \ninterface that were followed by devastating tsunamis, including the 1960 M9.5 \nearthquake in southern Chile, the largest instrumentally recorded earthquake in \nthe world. Other notable shallow tsunami-generating earthquakes include the \n1906 M8.5 earthquake near Esmeraldas, Ecuador, the 1922 M8.5 earthquake \nnear Coquimbo, Chile, the 2001 M8.4 Arequipa, Peru earthquake, the 2007 \nM8.0 earthquake near Pisco, Peru, and the 2010 M8.8 Maule, Chile earthquake \nlocated just north of the 1960 event.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nLarge intermediate-depth earthquakes (those occurring between depths of \napproximately 70 and 300 km) are relatively limited in size and spatial extent in \nSouth America, and occur within the Nazca plate as a result of internal \ndeformation within the subducting plate. These earthquakes generally cluster \nbeneath northern Chile and southwestern Bolivia, and to a lesser extent beneath \nnorthern Peru and southern Ecuador, with depths between 110 and 130 km. Most \nof these earthquakes occur adjacent to the bend in the coastline between Peru \nand Chile. The most recent large intermediate-depth earthquake in this region was \nthe 2005 M7.8 Tarapaca, Chile earthquake.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nEarthquakes can also be generated to depths greater than 600 km as a \nresult of continued internal deformation of the subducting Nazca plate. \nDeep-focus earthquakes in South America are not observed from a depth \nrange of approximately 300 to 500 km. Instead, deep earthquakes in this \nregion occur at depths of 500 to 650 km and are concentrated into two \nzones: one that runs beneath the Peru-Brazil border and another that \nextends from central Bolivia to central Argentina. These earthquakes \ngenerally do not exhibit large magnitudes. An exception to this was the \n1994 Bolivian earthquake in northwestern Bolivia. This M8.2 earthquake occurred at a depth of 631 km, which was until recently the largest deep-focus earthquake instrumentally recorded (superseded in May 2013 by a M8.3 earthquake 610 km beneath the Sea of Okhotsk, Russia), and was felt widely throughout South and North America.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nSubduction of the Nazca plate is geometrically complex and impacts the geology \nand seismicity of the western edge of South America. The intermediate-depth \nregions of the subducting Nazca plate can be segmented into five sections based \non their angle of subduction beneath the South America plate. Three segments are \ncharacterized by steeply dipping subduction; the other two by near-horizontal \nsubduction. The Nazca plate beneath northern Ecuador, southern Peru to northern \nChile, and southern Chile descend into the mantle at angles of 25&deg; to 30&deg;. In contrast, \nthe slab beneath southern Ecuador to central Peru, and under central Chile, is \nsubducting at a shallow angle of approximately 10&deg; or less.  In these regions of \n&ldquo;flat-slab&rdquo; subduction, the Nazca plate moves horizontally for several hundred \nkilometers before continuing its descent into the mantle, and is shadowed by an \nextended zone of crustal seismicity in the overlying South America plate. Although the \nSouth America plate exhibits a chain of active volcanism resulting from the subduction \nand partial melting of the Nazca oceanic lithosphere along most of the arc, these \nregions of inferred shallow subduction correlate with an absence of volcanic activity.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/of\/2010\/1083\/e\/\" target=\"_blank\">\nMore information on regional seismicity and tectonics<\/a>\n<\/p>","type":"neic"}},{"type":"Feature","id":15,"geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-54.9999999996995,9.00000000010078],[-68.9999999995996,8.00000000030059],[-71.9999999998994,4.50000000010073],[-77.3000000000993,4.50000000010073],[-89.9999999998994,4.50000000010073],[-94.9999999997995,12.5000000003006],[-94.9999999997995,18.1142963021335],[-83.000000000399,19.499999999801],[-75.0000000001992,21.0000000004006],[-67.9999999997995,21.0000000004006],[-57.9999999999993,21.0000000004006],[-54.9999999996995,9.00000000010078]]]},"properties":{"name":"Caribbean","summary":"<h4>Seismotectonics of the Caribbean Region and Vicinity<\/h4>\n<a class=\"tectonic caribbean\" href=\"http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/earthquakes\/tectonic\/images\/caribbean_tsum.pdf\"><\/a>\n<p>\nExtensive diversity and complexity of tectonic regimes characterizes the perimeter \nof the Caribbean plate, involving no fewer than four major plates (North America, \nSouth America, Nazca, and Cocos). Inclined zones of deep earthquakes \n(Wadati-Benioff zones), ocean trenches, and arcs of volcanoes clearly indicate \nsubduction of oceanic lithosphere along the Central American and Atlantic Ocean \nmargins of the Caribbean plate, while crustal seismicity in Guatemala, northern \nVenezuela, and the Cayman Ridge and Cayman Trench indicate transform fault \nand pull-apart basin tectonics.\n<\/p>  \n<p>\nAlong the northern margin of the Caribbean plate, the North America plate moves \nwestwards with respect to the Caribbean plate at a velocity of approximately 20 \nmm\/yr. Motion is accommodated along several major transform faults that extend \neastward from Isla de Roatan to Haiti, including the Swan Island Fault and the \nOriente Fault. These faults represent the southern and northern boundaries of the \nCayman Trench. Further east, from the Dominican Republic to the Island of Barbuda, \nrelative motion between the North America plate and the Caribbean plate becomes \nincreasingly complex and is partially accommodated by nearly arc-parallel subduction \nof the North America plate beneath the Caribbean plate. This results in the formation \nof the deep Puerto Rico Trench and a zone of intermediate focus earthquakes \n(70-300 km depth) within the subducted slab. Although the Puerto Rico subduction \nzone is thought to be capable of generating a megathrust earthquake, there have \nbeen no such events in the past century. The last probable interplate (thrust fault) \nevent here occurred on May 2, 1787 and was widely felt throughout the island with \ndocumented destruction across the entire northern coast, including Arecibo and San \nJuan. Since 1900, the two largest earthquakes to occur in this region were the \nAugust 4, 1946 M8.0 Samana earthquake in northeastern Hispaniola and the July 29, \n1943 M7.6 Mona Passage earthquake, both of which were shallow thrust fault earthquakes. \nA significant portion of the motion between the North America plate and the Caribbean \nplate in this region is accommodated by a series of left-lateral strike-slip faults that bisect \nthe island of Hispaniola, notably the Septentrional Fault in the north and the \nEnriquillo-Plantain Garden Fault in the south. Activity adjacent to the Enriquillo-Plantain \nGarden Fault system is best documented by the devastating January 12, 2010 M7.0 Haiti \nstrike-slip earthquake, its associated aftershocks and a comparable earthquake in 1770.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nMoving east and south, the plate boundary curves around Puerto Rico and the northern \nLesser Antilles where the plate motion vector of the Caribbean plate relative to the North \nand South America plates is less oblique, resulting in active island-arc tectonics.  Here, the \nNorth and South America plates subduct towards the west beneath the Caribbean plate \nalong the Lesser Antilles Trench at rates of approximately 20 mm\/yr. As a result of this \nsubduction, there exists both intermediate focus earthquakes within the subducted plates \nand a chain of active volcanoes along the island arc. Although the Lesser Antilles is \nconsidered one of the most seismically active regions in the Caribbean, few of these events \nhave been greater than M7.0 over the past century. The island of Guadeloupe was the site \nof one of the largest megathrust earthquakes to occur in this region on February 8, 1843, \nwith a suggested magnitude greater than 8.0. The largest recent intermediate-depth \nearthquake to occur along the Lesser Antilles arc was the November 29, 2007 M7.4 \nMartinique earthquake northwest of Fort-De-France.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe southern Caribbean plate boundary with the South America plate strikes east-west \nacross Trinidad and western Venezuela at a relative rate of approximately 20 mm\/yr. \nThis boundary is characterized by major transform faults, including the Central Range \nFault and the Bocon&oacute;-San Sebastian-El Pilar Faults, and shallow seismicity. Since 1900, \nthe largest earthquakes to occur in this region were the October 29, 1900 M7.7 Caracas \nearthquake, and the July 29, 1967 M6.5 earthquake near this same region. Further to \nthe west, a broad zone of compressive deformation trends southwestward across western \nVenezuela and central Colombia. The plate boundary is not well defined across northwestern \nSouth America, but deformation transitions from being dominated by Caribbean\/South America \nconvergence in the east to Nazca\/South America convergence in the west. The transition zone \nbetween subduction on the eastern and western margins of the Caribbean plate is \ncharacterized by diffuse seismicity involving low- to intermediate-magnitude (M&lt;6.0) \nearthquakes of shallow to intermediate depth.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe plate boundary offshore of Colombia is also characterized by convergence, where the Nazca \nplate subducts beneath South America towards the east at a rate of approximately 65 mm\/yr.  \nThe January 31, 1906 M8.5 earthquake occurred on the shallowly dipping megathrust interface \nof this plate boundary segment.  Along the western coast of Central America, the Cocos plate \nsubducts towards the east beneath the Caribbean plate at the Middle America Trench. \nConvergence rates vary between 72-81 mm\/yr, decreasing towards the north. This subduction \nresults in relatively high rates of seismicity and a chain of numerous active volcanoes; \nintermediate-focus earthquakes occur within the subducted Cocos plate to depths of nearly 300 km. \nSince 1900, there have been many moderately sized intermediate-depth earthquakes in this region, \nincluding the September 7, 1915 M7.4 El Salvador and the October 5, 1950 M7.8 Costa Rica events.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe boundary between the Cocos and Nazca plates is characterized by a series of north-south trending \ntransform faults and east-west trending spreading centers. The largest and most seismically active of \nthese transform boundaries is the Panama Fracture Zone. The Panama Fracture Zone terminates in the \nsouth at the Galapagos rift zone and in the north at the Middle America trench, where it forms part of \nthe Cocos-Nazca-Caribbean triple junction. Earthquakes along the Panama Fracture Zone are generally \nshallow, low- to intermediate in magnitude (M&lt;7.2) and are characteristically right-lateral strike-slip \nfaulting earthquakes.

Segments of active extension occur from the Indian Ocean west to Botswana and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).  It is the only rift system in the world that is active on a continent-wide scale, providing geologists with a view of how continental rifts develop over time into oceanic spreading centers like the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.<\/p><p>Rifting in East Africa is not all coeval: volcanism and faulting have been an ongoing phenomenon on the continent since the Eocene (~45 Ma).  The rifting began in northern East Africa, and led to the separation of the Africa (Nubia) and Arabia plates in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, and in the Turkana area at the Kenya-Ethiopia border.  A Paleogene mantle superplume beneath East Africa caused extension within the Nubia plate, as well as a first order topographic high known as the African superswell which now includes most of the eastern and southern segments of the Nubia plate. Widespread volcanism erupted onto much of the rising plateau in Ethiopia during the Eocene-Oligocene (45 \u2013 29 Ma), with chains of volcanoes forming along the rift separating Africa and Arabia. Since the initiation of rifting in northeastern Africa, the system has propagated over 3000 km to the south and southwest, and it experiences seismicity as a direct result of the extension, as well as active magmatism.<\/p><p>Today extension and magmatism are localizing in distinct eastern, western, and southwestern branches, marking the edges of two or more microplates between the sub-parallel zones of extension in East Africa.  The borders of the microplates (known as Victoria and Rovuma) with the Nubia plate to the west and Somalia plate to the east now represent the most seismically active zones on the continent where normal faulting earthquakes occur on a monthly basis. They are also the sites of volcano-tectonic earthquakes. Along the rift, models of sparse GPS data and earthquake slip vectors predict average spreading rates of 1-4 mm\/yr, increasing from north to south in the western branch, and increasing from south to north in the east. <\/p><p>Seismicity in the East Africa Rift is widespread, but displays a distinct pattern. Seismicity is characterized by mainly shallow (< 40 km) normal faults (earthquakes rupturing as a direct result of extension of the crust), and volcano-tectonic earthquakes.  The majority of events occur in the 10-25 km depth range. This pattern is widespread throughout the EARS, and the relationship between depth of earthquakes, the deformation of continental lithosphere, and magmatic processes in many segments of the rift.   <\/p><p>The three limbs of the Afar triple junction zone experience major earthquakes, as well as frequent volcanic eruptions and dike intrusions.  The magnitude of earthquakes during volcano-tectonic events is usually less than M 6, but large volumes of magma accommodating plate opening may occur during these intense, smaller magnitude swarms.  The largest earthquakes recorded in this area occurred in a swarm, along a section of the evolving Arabia-Nubia plate boundary in Afar in August 1989.  Studies of this earthquake swarm show that the events occurred as a result of slip on conjugate normal faults bounding the narrow Dobi graben.  The swarm, made up of 25 M &ge; 4.2 earthquakes, occurred over 48 hours from 11:17 UT August 20, 1989.  The events were all shallower than 15 km as a result of the thin crust beneath the triple junction compared to the surrounding continental crust. Conversely, the deepest earthquake ever recorded on the African continent (~62 km) also occurred beneath the Afar triple junction on November 8th, 1978.  This M 4.9 earthquake occurred beneath an active spreading segment, and was probably associated with the movement of magma at depth during the rifting episode.<\/p><p>The western branch is divided into three main segments.  The northern and middle segments border the Nubia - Victoria microplate boundary, and the southern segment borders the Nubia - Rovuma boundary.  The northern segment comprises the West Nile region (WNR), and Lakes Albert, Kivu, and Edward (LAKE); the middle segment includes Lakes Tanganyika and Rukwa (LT, LR); and the southern segment encompasses Lake Malawi and central Mozambique (LM). The two largest instrumentally recorded events in Africa occurred ~ 300 km north of Lake Albert, in an area of Mesozoic (250-65 Ma) rifting.  These M 7.1 earthquakes struck four days apart in May 1990, both at ~ 15 km depth.  Their tectonic relationship to the Albert rift system or Mesozoic faults remains unclear. The most recent major earthquake to strike the region occurred on February 22nd, 2006.  This M 7.0 event struck at a depth of 11 km in central Mozambique around midnight local time, killing two and injuring 15.  The earthquake was felt in Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Swaziland, South Africa, and Zambia, but no major structural damage was reported.<\/p><p>The eastern branch is a discontinuous system of rifts, most of which have experienced magmatism since their onset. From north to south, these are the Ethiopian Rift (ER), the Kenya Rift (KR), the northern Tanzania divergence (NTD), and the Davie Ridge (DR). The Kenya Rift experienced a major M 6.9 earthquake in 1928, but has witnessed only small magnitude swarms since then. As in the Afar and Ethiopian rift segments where magma supply appears to be abundant, dike intrusions here accommodate extensional strain at lower stress levels than are required to cause slip along large fault systems bounding the rift, generally resulting in relatively smaller earthquakes. Seismicity near the northern Tanzania Divergence marks the diffuse, volcanically active Victoria - Somalia plate boundary. Consistent with the widespread magmatism in this rift sector earthquake magnitudes are generally less than M 6, and result from normal faulting.  The Davie Ridge marks the Rovuma - Somalia plate boundary in the oceanic lithosphere of the western Indian Ocean basin.

This subduction is responsible for the generation of the Aleutian Islands and the deep \noffshore Aleutian Trench. \n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe curvature of the arc results in a westward transition of relative plate motion from trench-normal \n(i.e., compressional) in the east to trench-parallel (i.e., translational) in the west, accompanied by westward \nvariations in seismic activity, volcanism, and overriding plate composition. The Aleutian arc is generally divided \ninto three regions: the western, central, and eastern Aleutians. Relative to a fixed North America plate, the \nPacific plate is moving northwest at a rate that increases from roughly 60 mm\/yr at the arc's eastern edge to \n76 mm\/yr near its western terminus. The eastern Aleutian arc extends from the Alaskan Peninsula in the east \nto the Fox Islands in the west. Motion along this section of the arc is characterized by arc-perpendicular \nconvergence and Pacific plate subduction beneath thick continental lithosphere. This region exhibits intense \nvolcanic activity and has a history of megathrust earthquakes.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe central Aleutian arc extends from the Andreanof Islands in the east to the Rat Islands in the west. Here, \nmotion is characterized by westward-increasing oblique convergence and Pacific plate subduction beneath thin \noceanic lithosphere. Along this portion of the arc, the Wadati-Benioff zone is well defined to depths of \napproximately 200 km. Despite the obliquity of convergence, active volcanism and megathrust earthquakes are \nalso present along this margin.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe western Aleutians, stretching from the western end of the Rat Islands in the east to the Commander Islands, \nRussia, in the west, is tectonically different from the central and eastern portions of the arc. The increasing \ncomponent of transform motion between the Pacific and North America plates is evidenced by diminishing active \nvolcanism; the last active volcano is located on Buldir Island, in the far western portion of the Rat Island chain. \nAdditionally, this portion of the subduction zone has not hosted large earthquakes or megathrust events in \nrecorded history. Instead, the largest earthquakes in this region are generally shallow, predominantly strike-slip \nevents with magnitudes between M5-6. Deeper earthquakes do occur, albeit rather scarcely and with small \nmagnitudes (M&lt;4), down to approximately 50 km. \n<\/p>\n<p>\nMost of the seismicity along the Aleutian arc results from thrust faulting that occurs along the interface between \nthe Pacific and North America plates, extending from near the base of the trench to depths of 40 to 60 km. Slip \nalong this interface is responsible for generating devastating earthquakes. Deformation also occurs within the \nsubducting slab in the form of intermediate-depth earthquakes that can reach depths of 250 km. Normal faulting \nevents occur in the outer rise region of the Aleutian arc resulting from the bending of the oceanic Pacific plate as \nit enters the Aleutian trench. Additionally, deformation of the overriding North America plate generates shallow \ncrustal earthquakes. \n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe Aleutian arc is a seismically active region, evidenced by the many moderate to large earthquakes occurring each \nyear. Since 1900, this region has hosted twelve large earthquakes (M&gt;7.5) including the May 7, 1986 M8.0 Andreanof \nIslands, the June 10, 1996 M7.9 Andreanof Islands, and the November 17, 2003 M7.8 Rat Islands earthquakes. Six of \nthese great earthquakes (M8.3 or larger) have occurred along the Aleutian arc that together have ruptured almost the \nentire shallow megathrust contact. The first of these major earthquakes occurred on August 17, 1906 near the island of \nAmchitka (M8.3) in the western Aleutian arc. However, unlike the other megathrust earthquakes along the arc, this event \nis thought to have been an intraplate event occurring in the shallow slab beneath the subduction zone interface.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe first megathrust event along the arc during the 20th century was the November 10, 1938 M8.6 Shumagin Island \nearthquake. This event ruptured an approximately 300 km long stretch of the arc from the southern end of Kodiak \nIsland to the northern end of the Shumagin Islands and generated a small tsunami that was recorded as far south as Hawaii.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe April 1, 1946 M8.6 Unimak Island earthquake, located in the central Aleutian arc, was characterized by slow rupture \nfollowed by a devastating Pacific-wide tsunami that was observed as far south as the shores of Antarctica. Although \ndamage from earthquake shaking was not severe locally, tsunami run-up heights were recorded as high as 42 m on \nUnimak Island and tsunami waves in Hilo, Hawaii also resulted in casualties. The slow rupture of this event has made it \ndifficult to constrain the focal mechanism and depth of the earthquake, though it is thought to have been an interplate \nthrust earthquake.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe next megathrust earthquake occurred along the central portion of the Aleutian arc near the Andreanof Islands on \nMarch 9, 1957, with a magnitude of M8.6. The rupture length of this event was approximately 1200 km, making it the \nlongest observed aftershock zone of all the historic Aleutian arc events. Although only limited seismic data from this event \nare still available, significant damage and tsunamis were observed on the islands of Adak and Unimak with tsunami heights \nof approximately 13 m.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe easternmost megathrust earthquake was the March 28, 1964 M9.2 Prince William Sound earthquake, currently the \nsecond largest recorded earthquake in the world. The event had a rupture length of roughly 700 km extending from Prince \nWilliam Sound in the northeast to the southern end of Kodiak Island in the southwest. Extensive damage was recorded in \nKenai, Moose Pass, and Kodiak but significant shaking was felt over a large region of Alaska, parts of western Yukon Territory, \nand British Columbia, Canada. Property damage was the largest in Anchorage, as a result of both the main shock shaking and \nthe ensuing landslides. This megathrust earthquake also triggered a devastating tsunami that caused damage along the Gulf \nof Alaska, the West Coast of the United States, and in Hawaii.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe westernmost Aleutians megathrust earthquake followed a year later on February 4, 1965. This M8.7 Rat Islands \nearthquake was characterized by roughly 600 km of rupture. Although this event is quite large, damage was low owing \nto the region's remote and sparsely inhabited location. A relatively small tsunami was recorded throughout the Pacific \nOcean with run-up heights up to 10.7 m on Shemya Island and flooding on Amchitka Island. \n<\/p>\n<p>\nAlthough the Aleutian arc is highly active, seismicity is rather discontinuous, with two regions that have not experienced \na large (M&gt;8.0) earthquake in the past century: the Commander Islands in the western Aleutians and the Shumagin \nIslands in the east. Due to the dominantly transform motion along the western arc, there is potential that the Commander \nIslands will rupture in a moderate to large strike-slip earthquake in the future. The Shumagin Islands region may also have \nhigh potential for hosting a large rupture in the future, though it has been suggested that little strain is being accumulated \nalong this section of the subduction zone, and thus associated hazards may be reduced.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nEast of the Aleutian arc along the Gulf of Alaska, crustal earthquakes occur as a result transmitted deformation and stress \nassociated with the northwestward convergence of the Pacific plate that collides a block of oceanic and continental material \ninto the North America plate. In 2002, the Denali Fault ruptured in a sequence of earthquakes that commenced with the \nOctober 23 M6.7 Nenana Mountain right-lateral strike-slip earthquake and culminated with the November 3, M7.9 Denali \nearthquake which started as a thrust earthquake along a then unrecognized fault and continued with a larger right-lateral \nstrike-slip event along the Denali and Totschunda Faults.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/of\/2010\/1083\/b\/\" target=\"_blank\"> More information on regional seismicity and tectonics<\/a>\n<\/p>","type":"neic"}},{"type":"Feature","id":42,"geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[107.150000000001,35.4699999999009],[98.3899999997013,18.4800000004005],[69.9999999996012,24.4700000003006],[69.9999999996012,27.6999999996012],[65.2400000003007,27.6999999996012],[66.4600000002008,41.999999999801],[66.4600000002008,44.2400000000009],[107.150000000001,35.4699999999009]]]},"properties":{"name":"Himalaya","summary":"<h4>Seismotectonics of the Himalaya and Vicinity<\/h4>\n<a class=\"tectonic himalaya\" href=\"http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/earthquakes\/tectonic\/images\/himalaya_tsum.pdf\"><\/a>\n<p>\nSeismicity in the Himalaya dominantly results from the continental collision of \nthe India and Eurasia plates, which are converging at a relative rate of 40-50 \nmm\/yr. Northward underthrusting of India beneath Eurasia generates numerous \nearthquakes and consequently makes this area one of the most seismically \nhazardous regions on Earth. The surface expression of the plate boundary \nis marked by the foothills of the north-south trending Sulaiman Range in the west, \nthe Indo-Burmese Arc in the east and the east-west trending Himalaya Front in \nthe north of India.\n<\/p>\n<p>   \nThe India-Eurasia plate boundary is a diffuse boundary, which in the region near \nthe north of India, lies within the limits of the Indus-Tsangpo (also called the Yarlung-Zangbo) \nSuture to the north and the Main Frontal Thrust to the south. The Indus-Tsangpo \nSuture Zone is located roughly 200 km north of the Himalaya Front and is defined \nby an exposed ophiolite chain along its southern margin. The narrow (&lt;200km) \nHimalaya Front includes numerous east-west trending, parallel structures. This \nregion has the highest rates of seismicity and largest earthquakes in the Himalaya \nregion, caused mainly by movement on thrust faults. Examples of significant \nearthquakes, in this densely populated region, caused by reverse slip movement \ninclude the 1934 M8.1 Bihar, the 1905 M7.5 Kangra and the 2005 M7.6 Kashmir \nearthquakes. The latter two resulted in the highest death tolls for Himalaya \nearthquakes seen to date, together killing over 100,000 people and leaving millions \nhomeless. The largest instrumentally recorded Himalaya earthquake occurred on 15th \nAugust 1950 in Assam, eastern India. This M8.6 right-lateral, strike-slip, earthquake \nwas widely felt over a broad area of central Asia, causing extensive damage to \nvillages in the epicentral region.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe Tibetan Plateau is situated north of the Himalaya, stretching approximately \n1000km north-south and 2500km east-west, and is geologically and tectonically \ncomplex with several sutures which are hundreds of kilometer-long and generally \ntrend east-west. The Tibetan Plateau is cut by a number of large (&gt;1000km) \neast-west trending, left-lateral, strike-slip faults, including the long Kunlun, Haiyuan, \nand the Altyn Tagh. Right-lateral, strike-slip faults (comparable in size to the left-lateral faults), \nin this region include the Karakorum, Red River, and Sagaing. Secondary north-south \ntrending normal faults also cut the Tibetan Plateau. Thrust faults are found towards \nthe north and south of the Tibetan Plateau. Collectively, these faults accommodate \ncrustal shortening associated with the ongoing collision of the India and Eurasia plates, \nwith thrust faults accommodating north south compression, and normal and strike-slip \naccommodating east-west extension.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nAlong the western margin of the Tibetan Plateau, in the vicinity of south-eastern \nAfghanistan and western Pakistan, the India plate translates obliquely relative to \nthe Eurasia plate, resulting in a complex fold-and-thrust belt known as the Sulaiman \nRange.  Faulting in this region includes strike-slip, reverse-slip and oblique-slip motion \nand often results in shallow, destructive earthquakes. The active, left-lateral, strike-slip \nChaman fault is the fastest moving fault in the region. In 1505, a segment of the \nChaman fault near Kabul, Afghanistan, ruptured causing widespread destruction. In \nthe same region the more recent 30 May 1935, M7.6 Quetta earthquake, which \noccurred in the Sulaiman Range in Pakistan, killed between 30,000 and 60,000 \npeople.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nOn the north-western side of the Tibetan Plateau, beneath the Pamir-Hindu Kush \nMountains of northern Afghanistan, earthquakes occur at depths as great as 200 km \nas a result of remnant lithospheric subduction. The curved arc of deep earthquakes \nfound in the Hindu Kush Pamir region indicates the presence of a lithospheric body \nat depth, thought to be remnants of a subducting slab.  Cross-sections through the \nHindu Kush region suggest a near vertical northerly-dipping subducting slab, whereas \ncross-sections through the nearby Pamir region to the east indicate a much shallower \ndipping, southerly subducting slab. Some models suggest the presence of two \nsubduction zones; with the Indian plate being subducted beneath the Hindu Kush \nregion and the Eurasian plate being subducted beneath the Pamir region. However, \nother models suggest that just one of the two plates is being subducted and that the \nslab has become contorted and overturned in places.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nShallow crustal earthquakes also occur in this region near the Main Pamir Thrust and \nother active Quaternary faults. The Main Pamir Thrust, north of the Pamir Mountains, \nis an active shortening structure. The northern portion of the Main Pamir Thrust \nproduces many shallow earthquakes, whereas its western and eastern borders display \na combination of thrust and strike-slip mechanisms. On the 18 February 1911, the M7.4 \nSarez earthquake ruptured in the Central Pamir Mountains, killing numerous people and \ntriggering a landside, which blocked the Murghab River.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nFurther north, the Tian Shan is a seismically active intra-continental mountain belt, which \nextends 2500 km in an ENE-WNW orientation north of the Tarim Basin. This belt is defined \nby numerous east-west trending thrust faults, creating a compressional basin and range \nlandscape. It is generally thought that regional stresses associated with the collision of \nthe India and Eurasia plates are responsible for faulting in the region. The region has had \nthree major earthquakes (&gt;M7.6) at the start of the 20th Century, including the 1902 \nAtushi earthquake, which killed an estimated 5,000 people. The range is cut through in the \nwest by the 700-km-long, northwest-southeast striking, Talas-Ferghana active right-lateral, \nstrike-slip fault system. Though the system has produced no major earthquakes in the last \n250 years, paleo-seismic studies indicate that it has the potential to produce M7.0+ \nearthquakes and it is thought to represent a significant hazard.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe northern portion of the Tibetan Plateau itself is largely dominated by the motion on \nthree large left-lateral, strike-slip fault systems; the Altyn Tagh, Kunlun and Haiyuan. \nThe Altyn Tagh fault is the longest of these strike slip faults and it is thought to \naccommodate a significant portion of plate convergence. However, this system has not \nexperienced significant historical earthquakes, though paleoseismic studies show \nevidence of prehistoric M7.0-8.0 events.  Thrust faults link with the Altyn Tagh at its \neastern and western termini. The Kunlun Fault, south of the Altyn Tagh, is seismically \nactive, producing large earthquakes such as the 8th November 1997, M7.6 Manyi \nearthquake and the 14th November 2001, M7.8 Kokoxili earthquake. The Haiyuan Fault, \nin the far north-east, generated the 16 December 1920, M7.8 earthquake that killed \napproximately 200,000 people and the 22 May 1927 M7.6 earthquake that killed 40,912.  \n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe Longmen Shan thrust belt, along the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, is an \nimportant structural feature and forms a transitional zone between the complexly \ndeformed Songpan-Garze Fold Belt and the relatively undeformed Sichuan Basin. On \n12 May 2008, the thrust belt produced the reverse slip, M7.9 Wenchuan earthquake, \nkilling over 87,000 people and causing billions of US dollars in damages and landslides \nwhich dammed several rivers and lakes.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nSoutheast of the Tibetan Plateau are the right-lateral, strike-slip Red River and the \nleft-lateral, strike-slip Xiangshuihe-Xiaojiang fault systems. The Red River Fault \nexperienced large scale, left-lateral ductile shear during the Tertiary period before \nchanging to its present day right-lateral slip rate of approximately 5 mm\/yr. This fault \nhas produced several earthquakes &gt;M6.0 including the 4 January 1970, M7.5 \nearthquake in Tonghai which killed over 10,000 people. Since the start of the 20th \ncentury, the Xiangshuihe-Xiaojiang Fault system has generated several M7.0+ \nearthquakes including the M7.5 Luhuo earthquake which ruptured on the 22 April 1973. \nSome studies suggest that due to the high slip rate on this fault, future large earthquakes \nare highly possible along the 65km stretch between Daofu and Qianning and the 135km \nstretch that runs through Kangding.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nShallow earthquakes within the Indo-Burmese Arc, predominantly occur on a combination \nof strike-slip and reverse faults, including the Sagaing, Kabaw and Dauki faults. Between \n1930 and 1956, six M7.0+ earthquakes occurred near the right-lateral Sagaing Fault, \nresulting in severe damage in Myanmar including the generation of landslides, liquefaction \nand the loss of 610 lives. Deep earthquakes (200km) have also been known to occur in \nthis region, these are thought to be due to the subduction of the eastwards dipping, India \nplate, though whether subduction is currently active is debated. Within the pre-instrumental \nperiod, the large Shillong earthquake occurred on the 12 June 1897, causing widespread \ndestruction.\n<\/p>","type":"neic"}},{"type":"Feature","id":44,"geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[33.2000000003006,30.0000000004006],[-21.9999999999992,30.0000000004006],[-21.9999999999992,48.0000000004006],[33.2000000003006,48.0000000004006],[33.2000000003006,30.0000000004006]]]},"properties":{"name":"Mediterranean","summary":"<h4>Seismotectonics of the Mediterranean Region and Vicinity<\/h4>\n<a class=\"tectonic mediterranean\" href=\"http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/earthquakes\/tectonic\/images\/mediterranean_tsum.pdf\"><\/a>\n<p>\nThe Mediterranean region is seismically active due to the \nnorthward convergence (4-10 mm\/yr) of the African plate \nwith respect to the Eurasian plate along a complex plate \nboundary.  This convergence began approximately 50 Ma and \nwas associated with the closure of the Tethys Sea.  The \nmodern day remnant of the Tethys Sea is the Mediterranean \nSea.  The highest rates of seismicity in the Mediterranean \nregion are found along the Hellenic subduction zone of \nsouthern Greece, along the North Anatolian Fault Zone of \nwestern Turkey and the Calabrian subduction zone of southern \nItaly.  Local high rates of convergence at the Hellenic \nsubduction zone (35mm\/yr) are associated with back-arc \nspreading throughout Greece and western Turkey above the \nsubducting Mediterranean oceanic crust. Crustal normal \nfaulting throughout this region is a manifestation of \nextensional tectonics associated with the back-arc spreading.  \nThe region of the Marmara Sea is a transition zone between \nthis extensional regime, to the west, and the strike-slip \nregime of the North Anatolian Fault Zone, to the east.  The \nNorth Anatolian Fault accommodates much of the right-lateral \nhorizontal motion (23-24 mm\/yr) between the Anatolian micro-plate \nand Eurasian plate as the Anatolian micro-plate is being \npushed westward to further accommodate closure of the \nMediterranean basin caused by the collision of the African \nand Arabian plates in southeastern Turkey.  Subduction of \nthe Mediterranean Sea floor beneath the Tyrrhenian Sea at \nthe Calabrian subduction zone causes a significant zone of \nseismicity around Sicily and southern Italy. Active volcanoes \nare located above intermediate depth earthquakes in the \nCyclades of the Aegean Sea and in southern Italy.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nIn the Mediterranean region there is a written record, several \ncenturies long, documenting pre-instrumental seismicity (pre-20th \ncentury).  Earthquakes have historically caused widespread damage \nacross central and southern Greece, Cyprus, Sicily, Crete, the \nNile Delta, Northern Libya, the Atlas Mountains of North Africa \nand the Iberian Peninsula.  The 1903 M8.2 Kythera earthquake and \nthe 1926 M7.8 Rhodes earthquakes are the largest instrumentally \nrecorded Mediterranean earthquakes, both of which are associated \nwith subduction zone tectonics.  Between 1939 and 1999 a series \nof devastating M7+ strike-slip earthquakes propagated westward \nalong the North Anatolian Fault Zone, beginning with the 1939 \nM7.8 Erzincan earthquake on the eastern end of the North Anatolian \nFault system.  The 1999 M7.6 Izmit earthquake, located on the \nwestward end of the fault, struck one of Turkey's most densely \npopulated and industrialized urban areas killing, more than 17,000 \npeople.  Although seismicity rates are comparatively low along \nthe northern margin of the African continent, large destructive \nearthquakes have been recorded and reported from Morocco in the \nwestern Mediterranean, to the Dead Sea in the eastern Mediterranean.  \nThe 1980 M7.3 El Asnam earthquake was one of Africa's largest and \nmost destructive earthquakes within the 20th century.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nLarge earthquakes throughout the Mediterranean region have also \nbeen known to produce significant and damaging tsunamis.  One of \nthe more prominent historical earthquakes within the region is \nthe Lisbon earthquake of November 1, 1755, whose magnitude has \nbeen estimated from non-instrumental data to be about 8.0.  The \n1755 Lisbon earthquake is thought to have occurred within or near \nthe Azores-Gibraltar transform fault, which defines the boundary \nbetween the African and Eurasian plates off the west coast of Morocco \nand Portugal. The earthquake is notable for both a large death \ntoll of approximately 60,000 people and for generating a tsunami \nthat swept up the Portuguese coast inundating coastal villages \nand Lisbon.  An earthquake of approximately M8.0 near Sicily in \n1693 generated a large tsunami wave that destroyed numerous towns \nalong Sicily's east coast.  The M7.2 December 28, 1908 Messina \nearthquake is the deadliest documented European earthquake.

A magnitude 4.0 eastern U.S. earthquake typically can be felt at many \nplaces as far as 100 km (60 mi) from where it occurred, and it infrequently causes \ndamage near its source. A magnitude 5.5 eastern U.S. earthquake usually can be felt as \nfar as 500 km (300 mi) from where it occurred, and sometimes causes damage as far \naway as 40 km (25 mi).\n<\/p>\n\n<h4>Faults<\/h4>\n<p>\nEarthquakes everywhere occur on faults within bedrock, usually miles deep.

In contrast, east of the Rocky Mountains this is rarely the case. The inland \nCarolinas region is far from the nearest plate boundaries, which are in the center of the \nAtlantic Ocean and in the Caribbean Sea. The region is laced with known faults but \nnumerous smaller or deeply buried faults remain undetected. Even the known faults are \npoorly located at earthquake depths. Accordingly, few, if any, earthquakes in the inland \nCarolinas can be linked to named faults. It is difficult to determine if a known fault is still \nactive and could slip and cause an earthquake.

During the winter of 1811-1812\nthree very large earthquakes devastated the area and were felt throughout most of the \nNation. They occurred a few weeks apart on \n<a href=\"http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/earthquakes\/states\/events\/1811-1812.php\"> December 16, \nJanuary 23, and February 7<\/a>. \nHundreds of aftershocks, some severely damaging by themselves, \ncontinued for years. \nPrehistoric earthquakes similar in size to those of 1811-1812 occurred \nin the middle \n1400's and around 900 A.D. Strong, damaging earthquakes struck the southwestern \nend \nof the seismic zone near Marked Tree, Arkansas in 1843 (magnitude 6.3), and the \nnortheastern end near Charleston, Missouri in 1895 (magnitude 6.6). Since 1900, \nmoderately damaging earthquakes have struck the seismic zone every few decades. \nAbout twice a year people feel still smaller earthquakes that do not cause damage.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nEarthquakes in the central and eastern U.S. are typically felt over a much broader region \nthan in the western U.S. East of the Rockies, an earthquake can be felt over an area as \nmuch as ten times larger than a similar magnitude earthquake on the west coast.

A \nmagnitude 5.5 eastern U.S. earthquake usually can be felt as far as 500 km (300 mi) from \nwhere it occurred, and sometimes causes damage as far away as 40 km (25 mi).\n<\/p>\n\n<h4>Faults<\/h4>\n<p>\nEarthquakes everywhere occur on faults within bedrock, usually miles deep. The \nearthquakes of the New Madrid seismic zone occur within a large network of faults called \nthe Reelfoot rift. The rift formed about 500 million years ago, when this region was \nstretched in the northwest-southeast direction. Along a northeast-southwest zone at least \n70 km (40 mi) wide and 500 km (300 mi) long, the rocks in the rift were slowly dropped \ndown about 1-2 km (1 mi) along some of the faults. Now the region is undergoing east-\nwest shortening, and the ancient faults of the Reelfoot rift are being reactivated to \ngenerate earthquakes.  Today the Reelfoot rift and the New Madrid seismic zone are \n2,000 km (1,200 mi) from the nearest plate boundary, which is in the Caribbean Sea.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe network of faults in the seismic zone is buried beneath hundreds to thousands of feet \nof sand and mud. Four of the largest faults are recognized as alignments of abundant \nsmall earthquakes, and movements along two of these faults dammed rivers and created \nlakes during the earthquakes of 1811-1812. A few more deeply buried faults were \ndetected during oil and gas exploration, and a few small faults are known from geologic \nmapping. However, many earthquakes occur away from the few known faults, so there \nmust be additional, unknown faults that can generate earthquakes in the seismic zone. \nAccordingly, the best overall guide to seismic hazard in the New Madrid seismic zone is \nthe earthquakes themselves.\n<\/p>\n<!--\n New Madrid seismic zone.doc, 07\/23\/03, Page 1 of 1\n -->","type":"neic"}},{"type":"Feature","id":19,"geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-73.5060729972703,41.8006668088271],[-73.506416320656,41.7957878113593],[-73.515388488887,41.6982192986826],[-73.5167694086806,41.6779861444459],[-73.5231704709398,41.5839958192526],[-73.52687835685,41.5523948665308],[-73.5282135002521,41.5410041811989],[-73.5377655036744,41.4268341071092],[-73.548233032228,41.3012580870919],[-73.5484390255399,41.2987899777762],[-73.544532776166,41.291164398619],[-73.4967041021119,41.2327919011262],[-73.4967041021119,41.209014892824],[-73.4967041021119,40.5228767393709],[-73.4984893804798,40.5209617616769],[-73.5904922480182,40.4221191407866],[-74.483528137313,39.4626655583697],[-75.6958389283232,39.4460868838036],[-75.7740936277181,39.739528655424],[-74.6944808964755,41.3683891296555],[-74.4161605838432,41.5364074710289],[-73.9857406621012,41.7962341314009],[-73.5060729972703,41.8006668088271]]]},"properties":{"name":"New York - Philadelphia - Wilmington","summary":"<h4>Earthquakes in the New York - Philadelphia - Wilmington Urban Corridor<\/h4>\n<p>\nSince colonial times people in the New York - Philadelphia - Wilmington urban corridor \nhave felt small earthquakes and suffered damage from infrequent larger ones.

England","summary":"<h4>Earthquakes in New England<\/h4>\n<p>\nPeople in New England, and in its geological extension southward through Long Island, \nhave felt small earthquakes and suffered damage from infrequent larger ones since \ncolonial times. Moderately damaging earthquakes strike somewhere in the region every \nfew decades, and smaller earthquakes are felt roughly twice a year. The Boston area was \ndamaged three times within 28 years in the middle 1700's, and New York City was \ndamaged in 1737 and 1884. The largest known New England earthquakes occurred in \n1638 (magnitude 6.5) in Vermont or New Hampshire, and in 1755 (magnitude 5.8) \noffshore from Cape Ann northeast of Boston. The Cape Ann earthquake caused severe \ndamage to the Boston waterfront. The most recent New England earthquake to cause \nmoderate damage occurred in 1940 (magnitude 5.6) in central New Hampshire.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nEarthquakes in the central and eastern U.S., although less frequent than in the western \nU.S., are typically felt over a much broader region. East of the Rockies, an earthquake \ncan be felt over an area as much as ten times larger than a similar magnitude earthquake \non the west coast. A magnitude 4.0 eastern U.S. earthquake typically can be felt at many \nplaces as far as 100 km (60 mi) from where it occurred, and it infrequently causes \ndamage near its source. A magnitude 5.5 eastern U.S. earthquake usually can be felt as \nfar as 500 km (300 mi) from where it occurred, and sometimes causes damage as far \naway as 40 km (25 mi).\n<\/p>\n<h4>Faults<\/h4>\n<p>\nEarthquakes everywhere occur on faults within bedrock, usually miles deep, although \nsome New England earthquakes occur at shallower depths. Most of New England's and \nLong Island's bedrock was assembled as continents collided to form a supercontinent \n500-300 million years ago, raising the northern Appalachian Mountains. The rest of the \nbedrock formed when the supercontinent rifted apart 200 million years ago to form what \nare now the northeastern U.S., the Atlantic Ocean, and Europe.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nAt well-studied plate boundaries like the San Andreas fault system in California, often \nscientists can determine the name of the specific fault that is responsible for an \nearthquake. In contrast, east of the Rocky Mountains this is rarely the case. New England \nand Long Island are far from the nearest plate boundaries, which are in the center of the \nAtlantic Ocean and in the Caribbean Sea. New England is laced with known faults but \nnumerous smaller or deeply buried faults remain undetected. Even the known faults are \npoorly located at the depths of most earthquakes. Accordingly, few, if any, earthquakes in \nNew England can be linked to named faults. It is difficult to determine if a known fault is \nstill active and could slip and cause an earthquake. As in most other areas east of the \nRockies, the best guide to earthquake hazards in New England and Long Island is the \nearthquakes themselves.\n<\/p>\n<!--\n New England.doc, 07\/23\/03, Page 1 of 1\n -->","type":"neic"}},{"type":"Feature","id":33,"geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-70.3000030519986,47.2000007628259],[-70.5000000001992,47.2999992364765],[-70.5500030523983,47.4500007632255],[-70.3000030519986,47.7000007627259],[-70.0000000002991,47.8499984745509],[-69.8000030511992,47.9000015258507],[-69.5999984740496,47.7999992372759],[-69.8499984744494,47.4500007632255],[-70.3000030519986,47.2000007628259]]]},"properties":{"name":"Charlevoix","summary":"<h4>Earthquakes in the Charlevoix-Kamouraska Seismic Zone<\/h4>\n<p>\nThe Charlevoix-Kamouraska seismic zone straddles the St. Lawrence River in \nsoutheastern Quebec.

Current thinking is that larger earthquakes in the seismic \nzone may occur on large faults that parallel the St. Lawrence River, whereas most of the \nsmaller earthquakes may occur in highly fractured rock near the large faults.\n<\/p>\n<!-- Charlevoix.doc, 07\/23\/03, Page 1 of 1\n -->","type":"neic"}},{"type":"Feature","id":38,"geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-104.830000000299,31.9900000002007],[-104.830000000299,31.9800000004006],[-104.780000000399,31.9000000002007],[-104.709999999999,31.829999999801],[-104.669999999899,31.7899999997011],[-104.6399999996,31.7700000001008],[-104.560000000299,31.6999999997011],[-104.5499999996,31.689999999901],[-104.510000000399,31.6300000002007],[-104.470000000299,31.5400000002007],[-104.4499999998,31.5199999997011],[-104.4099999997,31.469999999801],[-104.340000000199,31.4000000003007],[-104.2799999996,31.329999999901],[-104.2299999997,31.2700000002008],[-104.219999999899,31.2600000004006],[-104.160000000199,31.1800000002007],[-104.150000000399,31.1700000004006],[-104.120000000099,31.1400000001008],[-104.079999999999,31.1000000000009],[-104.0099999996,31.0400000003007],[-103.940000000099,30.9799999997011],[-103.930000000299,30.9799999997011],[-103.840000000299,30.9299999998011],[-103.760000000099,30.879999999901],[-103.660000000299,30.839999999801],[-103.629999999999,30.8300000000009],[-103.5599999996,30.8200000002007],[-103.520000000399,30.8100000004006],[-103.409999999899,30.7899999999009],[-103.409999999899,30.7800000001008],[-103.319999999899,30.749999999801],[-103.269999999999,30.7300000002007],[-103.220000000099,30.7099999997011],[-103.1499999997,30.6800000003007],[-103.130000000099,30.6800000003007],[-103.0599999997,30.6500000000009],[-103.030000000299,30.6400000002008],[-102.950000000099,30.6099999999009],[-102.940000000299,30.6000000001008],[-102.850000000299,30.5600000000009],[-102.810000000199,30.5299999997011],[-102.770000000099,30.5000000003006],[-102.720000000199,30.4399999997011],[-102.710000000399,30.429999999901],[-102.6499999998,30.3600000004006],[-102.6499999998,30.3499999997011],[-102.599999999899,30.2800000002007],[-102.5699999996,30.2400000001008],[-102.540000000199,30.2000000000009],[-102.500000000099,30.1500000001008],[-102.490000000299,30.1199999998011],[-102.440000000399,30.0500000003007],[-102.440000000399,30.0399999996012],[-102.3899999996,29.9600000003007],[-102.369999999999,29.9300000000009],[-102.350000000399,29.8800000001008],[-102.3399999997,29.8700000003006],[-101.770000000299,29.259999999901],[-101.3499999997,28.6799999998011],[-100.650000000199,27.8699999998011],[-100.079999999899,27.1700000003007],[-99.4599999996996,26.429999999801],[-98.6700000001993,25.7000000000009],[-97.6599999996996,24.8800000002007],[-97.4000000003991,24.719999999801],[-97.1699999995997,24.6000000004005],[-96.9500000003991,24.4999999997011],[-96.7099999997995,24.3699999996012],[-96.5699999998994,24.4800000001008],[-96.4700000000993,24.7699999997011],[-96.4100000003991,24.989999999801],[-96.2699999995997,25.2400000002007],[-96.1599999999994,25.5799999997011],[-96.0699999999994,25.9899999996012],[-96.0799999997996,26.2300000002007],[-96.0899999995997,26.4600000001008],[-96.0399999996996,26.8500000004006],[-95.9799999999994,27.1099999997011],[-95.8999999997995,27.2499999996012],[-95.7199999997995,27.3699999999009],[-95.5100000003991,27.4500000001008],[-95.3300000003991,27.4800000004006],[-94.9999999997995,27.509999999801],[-94.9999999997995,27.3000000004006],[-94.9999999997995,27.0999999999009],[-94.9999999997995,14.999999999801],[-120.000000000199,14.999999999801],[-120.000000000199,31.9400000003006],[-119.9799999997,32.0000000000009],[-115.019999999899,32.0000000000009],[-105.820000000299,32.0000000000009],[-104.830000000299,32.0000000000009],[-104.830000000299,31.9900000002007]]]},"properties":{"name":"Mexico","summary":"<h4>Seismotectonics of Mexico<\/h4>\n<a class=\"tectonic mexico\" href=\"http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/earthquakes\/tectonic\/images\/mexico_tsum.pdf\"><\/a>\n<p>\nLocated atop three of the large tectonic plates, Mexico \nis one of the world's most seismically active regions. \nThe relative motion of these crustal plates causes frequent \nearthquakes and occasional volcanic eruptions. \nMost of the \nMexican landmass is on the westward moving North American \nplate. The Pacific Ocean floor south of Mexico is being \ncarried northeastward by the underlying Cocos plate. Because \noceanic crust is relatively dense, when the Pacific Ocean \nfloor encounters the lighter continental crust of the Mexican \nlandmass, the ocean floor is subducted beneath the North \nAmerican plate creating the deep Middle American trench \nalong Mexico's southern coast. Also as a result of this \nconvergence, the westward moving Mexico landmass is slowed \nand crumpled creating the mountain ranges of southern Mexico \nand earthquakes near Mexico's southern coast. As the oceanic \ncrust is pulled downward, it melts; the molten material is then \nforced upward through weaknesses in the overlying continental \ncrust. This process has created a region of volcanoes across \nsouth-central Mexico known as the Cordillera Neovolc&aacute;nica.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe area west of the Gulf of California, including Mexico's Baja \nCalifornia Peninsula, is moving northwestward with the Pacific \nplate at about 50 mm per year. Here, the Pacific and North American \nplates grind past each other creating strike-slip faulting, the \nsouthern extension of California's San Andreas fault. In the past, \nthis relative plate motion pulled Baja California away from the coast \nforming the Gulf of California and is the cause of earthquakes in the \nGulf of California region today.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nMexico has a long history of destructive earthquakes and volcanic \neruptions. In September 1985, a magnitude 8.0 earthquake killed \nmore than 9,500 people in Mexico City. In southern Mexico, Volc&aacute;n \nde Colima and El Chich&oacute;n erupted in 2005 and 1982, respectively. \nParicut&iacute;n volcano, west of Mexico City, began venting smoke in a \ncornfield in 1943; a decade later this new volcano had grown to a \nheight of 424 meters. Popocat&eacute;petl and Ixtacc&iacute;huatl volcanos \n(&quot;smoking mountain&quot; and &quot;white lady&quot;, respectively), southeast \nof Mexico City, occasionally vent gas that can be clearly seen from the City, \na reminder that volcanic activity is ongoing. In 1994 and 2000 Popocat&eacute;petl \nrenewed its activity forcing the evacuation of nearby towns, causing \nseismologists and government officials to be concerned about the effect a \nlarge-scale

It marks the region where the Pacific plate subducts into the mantle beneath the Okhotsk mircoplate, a proposed regional subdivision of the larger North America plate. This subduction is responsible for the generation of the Kuril Islands chain, volcanoes along the entire arc, and the deep Kuril-Kamchatka Trench. Relative to a fixed North America plate, the Pacific plate is moving northwest at a rate that increases from 79 mm\/yr near the northern end of the arc to 83 mm\/yr adjacent to Hokkaido.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nIn the southern section of the Kuril arc oblique subduction results in the partitioning of stress into both trench-normal thrust earthquakes (e.g., the 12\/03\/1995 M 7.9 Kuril Island event) and trench-parallel strike-slip earthquakes (e.g., the 10\/16\/1994 M 6.7 Kuril Island event). This oblique convergence also drives the southwestern translation of the Kuril Arc, and its collision with the Japan Arc. The collision in turn drives the uplift of the Hidaka Mountains, and causes northwest-southeast oriented compressional earthquakes across Hokkaido.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nNorth of approximately 44&deg; latitude, adjacent to the island of Urup, convergence becomes dominantly trench normal.  In this area, cross-sections of the subduction zone reveal a well-defined Wadati-Benioff zone extending to depths of 650 km, supporting assumptions that the Pacific plate is relatively old and has been subducting for close to 100 Myr. As the arc approaches its northern terminus off the coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula, the character of subduction changes again due to the entrainment of the Meiji Seamount and the influence of transform motion along westernmost extent of the Aleutian Arc. The angle of subduction decreases from 55 to 35 degrees from south to north, and the maximum depth of seismicity decreases from ~600 km to ~200 km, causing a northwestern deviation in the volcanic front.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe Kuril-Kamchatka Arc is one of the most seismically active regions in the world. Deformation of the overriding North America plate and associated microplates generates shallow crustal earthquakes, while slip at the subduction zone interface between the Pacific and North America plates generates interplate earthquakes that extend from near the base of the trench to depths of 40 to 60 km. The aftershock zones of great historic earthquakes abut one another along the strike of the arc but generally do not overlap; sections of the subduction zone have typically experienced earthquakes of a consistent size at fairly regular recurrence intervals, though the length of seismicity catalogs is typically shorter than the expected repeat times of the largest earthquakes known to have occurred in the region.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nPatterns in along-arc seismicity can reveal seismic gaps, zones where no great ruptures have occurred for an anomalously long period of time. In the Kuril region, a gap between Simushir Island and Onekotan Island that had remained unruptured by a large earthquake since 1780 was the site of an M 8.3 event on November 15, 2006. Minutes after the November 15 earthquake, aftershocks began rupturing one or more faults near the outer rise region seaward of the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench, adjacent to the location of the main shock. On January 13, 2007, two months after the 2006 event, a great (M 8.1) normal faulting earthquake occurred in this same region. Because the January 2007 event ruptured within the aftershock zone of the November 2006 quake, it is speculated to be the result of changes in the regional stress field following the earlier event, despite occurring on a different fault.  The inferred coupling of the 2006 and 2007 events make them one of the largest earthquake doublets to have ever been recorded.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe Kuril-Kamchatka region frequently experiences large (M&ge;7) and great (M&ge;8) earthquakes. In the 114 years since 1900, 133 large and 12 great earthquakes have occurred along the arc. Damaging tsunamis followed several of the large interplate megathrust earthquakes, including the September 25, 2003 M 8.3 Hokkaido earthquake, and the November 6, 1958 M 8.4 Etorofu event. The February 3, 1923 M 8.4 Kamchatka earthquake generated an 8 m transoceanic tsunami. On October 13, 1963, a M 8.5 megathrust earthquake off the coast of the island of Urup generated a large tsunami in the Pacific Ocean and the Sea of Okhotsk, with run-up wave heights of up to 4-5 m.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe largest megathrust earthquake to occur along the arc in the 20th century was the November 4, 1952 M 9.0 event, to date the 5th largest instrumentally recorded earthquake in history. This earthquake was followed by a devastating tsunami with run-up wave heights as high as 12 m along the coast of Paramushir, causing significant damage to the city of Severo-Kurilsk. Intraplate earthquakes have also been known to cause significant damage in the region. On October 4, 1994, a large (M8.3) intraplate event occurred within the subducted oceanic lithosphere of the Pacific plate off the coast of Shikotan Island, causing intense ground shaking, landslides, and a tsunami with run-up heights of up to 10 m on the island.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nWhile most large earthquakes along the Kuril-Kamchatka Arc occur at shallow or intermediate depths, the region also hosts large events that rupture at depths greater than 300 km. The most significant of these deep-focus earthquakes to date was the May 24, 2013 M 8.3 event beneath the Sea of Okhotsk, currently the largest deep-focus earthquake on record. The earthquake occurred as the result of normal faulting within the subducted Pacific slab approximately 600 km below the Earth's surface, and was felt as far away as Moscow, Russia, nearly 6,500 km to the west.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/of\/2010\/1083\/c\/\" target=\"_blank\">\nMore information on regional seismicity and tectonics<\/a>\n<\/p>","type":"neic"}},{"type":"Feature","id":45,"geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[65.2400000003007,27.6999999996012],[69.9999999996012,27.6999999996012],[69.9999999996012,22.0000000002007],[33.2000000003006,22.0000000002007],[33.2000000003006,41.999999999801],[66.4600000002008,41.999999999801],[65.2400000003007,27.6999999996012]]]},"properties":{"name":"Middle East","summary":"<h4>Seismotectonics of the Middle East and Vicinity<\/h4>\n<a class=\"tectonic middleeast\" href=\"http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/earthquakes\/tectonic\/images\/middleeast_tsum.pdf\"><\/a>\n<p> \nNo fewer than four major tectonic plates (Arabia, Eurasia, India, and Africa) \nand one smaller tectonic block (Anatolia) are responsible for seismicity and \ntectonics in the Middle East and surrounding region.  Geologic development \nof the region is a consequence of a number of first-order plate tectonic \nprocesses that include subduction, large-scale transform faulting, compressional \nmountain building and crustal extension.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nMountain building in northern Pakistan and Afghanistan is the result of \ncompressional tectonics associated with collision of the India plate moving \nnorthwards at a rate of 40 mm\/yr with respect to the Eurasia plate. Continental \nthickening of the northern and western edge of the India subcontinent has \nproduced the highest mountains in the world, including the Himalayan, \nKarakoram, Pamir and Hindu Kush ranges. Earthquake activity and faulting \nfound in this region, as well as adjacent parts of Afghanistan and India, are \ndue to collisional plate tectonics.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nBeneath the Pamir-Hindu Kush Mountains of northern Afghanistan, earthquakes \noccur to depths as great as 200 km as a result of remnant lithospheric subduction.  \nShallower crustal earthquakes in the Pamir-Hindu Mountains occur primarily along \nthe Main Pamir Thrust and other active Quaternary faults, which accommodate \nmuch of the region's crustal shortening.  The western and eastern margins of the \nMain Pamir Thrust display a combination of thrust and strike-slip mechanisms.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nAlong the western margin of the Tibetan Plateau, in the vicinity of southeastern \nAfghanistan and western Pakistan, the India plate translates obliquely relative to \nthe Eurasia plate, resulting in a complex fold-and-thrust belt known as the Sulaiman\n Range.  Faulting in this region includes strike-slip, reverse-slip and oblique-slip motion \nand often results in shallow, destructive earthquakes. The relatively fast moving \nleft-lateral, strike-slip Chaman Fault system in southeastern Afghanistan \naccommodates translational motion between the India and Eurasia plates. In 1505, a \nsegment of the Chaman Fault system near Kabul, Afghanistan ruptured causing \nwidespread destruction of Kabul and surrounding villages. In the same region, the \nmore recent 30 May 1935, M7.6 Quetta, Pakistan earthquake, occurred within the \nSulaiman Range, killing between 30,000 and 60,000 people. \n<\/p>\n<p>\nOff the south coast of Pakistan and southeast coast of Iran, the Makran trench is the \npresent-day surface expression of active subduction of the Arabia plate beneath the \ncontinental Eurasia plate, which converge at a rate of approximately 20 mm\/yr.  \nAlthough the Makran subduction zone has a relatively slow convergence rate, it has \nproduced large devastating earthquakes and tsunamis. For example, the November 27, \n1945 M8.0 mega-thrust earthquake produced a tsunami within the Gulf of Oman and \nArabia Sea, killing over 4,000 people.  Northwest of this active subduction zone, collision \nof the Arabia and Eurasia plates forms the approximately 1,500-km-long fold and thrust \nbelt of the Zagros Mountains, which crosses the whole of western Iran and extends into \nnortheastern Iraq.   Collision of the Arabia and Eurasia plates also causes crustal \nshortening in the Alborz Mountains and Kopet Dag in northern Iran. Eastern Iran \nexperiences destructive earthquakes that originate on both strike-slip and reverse faults. \nFor example, the 16 September 1978 M7.8 earthquake, along the southwest edge of the \nDasht-e-Lut Basin killed at least 15,000 people. \n<\/p>\n<p>\nAlong the eastern margin of the Mediterranean region there is complex interaction between \nthe Africa, Arabia and Eurasia plates. The Red Sea Rift is a spreading center between the \nAfrica and Arabia plates, with a spreading rate of approximately 10mm\/yr near its northern \nend, and 16mm\/yr near its southern end (Chu, D. and Gordon, R. G., 1998). Seismicity rate \nand size of earthquakes has been relatively small along the spreading center, but the rifting \nprocess has produced a series of volcanic systems across western Saudi Arabia. \n<\/p>\n<p>\nFurther north, the Red Sea Rift terminates at the southern boundary of the Dead Sea \nTransform Fault. The Dead Sea Transform is a strike-slip fault that accommodates \ndifferential motion between the Africa and Arabia plates. Though both the Africa plate, to \nthe west, and the Arabia plate, to the east, are moving in a NNE direction, the Arabia plate \nis moving slightly faster, resulting in the left-lateral, strike-slip motion along this segment of \nthe plate boundary. Historically, earthquake activity along the Dead Sea Transform has been \na significant hazard in the densely populated Levant region (eastern Mediterranean). For \nexample, the November 1759 Near East earthquake is thought to have killed somewhere \nbetween 2,000-20,000 people. The northern termination of the Dead Sea Transform occurs \nwithin a complex tectonic region of southeast Turkey, where interaction of the Africa and \nArabia plates and the Anatolia block occurs. This involves translational motion of the Anatolia \nBlock westwards, with a speed of approximately 25mm\/yr with respect to Eurasia, in order to \naccommodate closure of the Mediterranean basin.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe right-lateral, strike-slip North Anatolia Fault, in northern Turkey, accommodates much of \nthe westwards motion between the Anatolia Block and Eurasia Plate. Between 1939 and 1999, \na series of devastating M7.0+ strike-slip earthquakes propagated westwards along the North \nAnatolia Fault system. The westernmost of these earthquakes was the 17th August 1999, \nM7.6 Izmit earthquake, near the Sea of Marmara, killed approximately 17,000 people. \n<\/p>\n<p>\nAt the southern edge of the Anatolia Block lies the east-west trending Cyprian Arc with \nassociated levels of moderate seismicity. The Cyprian Arc represents the convergent boundary \nbetween the Anatolia Block to the north and the Africa Plate to the south. The boundary is \nthought to join the East Anatolia Fault zone in eastern Turkey; however no certain geometry or \nsense of relative motion along the entire boundary is widely accepted.\n<\/p>","type":"neic"}},{"type":"Feature","id":41,"geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[180,-65.000000000399],[163.999999999701,-65.000000000399],[163.999999999701,-9.99999999969941],[180,-9.99999999969941],[180,-65.000000000399]]],[[[-170.000000000099,-65.000000000399],[-179.9999999999,-65.000000000399],[-179.9999999999,-9.99999999969941],[-170.000000000099,-9.99999999969941],[-170.000000000099,-65.000000000399]]]]},"properties":{"name":"Eastern Margin Australia Plate","summary":"<h4>Seismotectonics of the Eastern Margin of the Australia Plate<\/h4>\n<a class=\"tectonic emaustralia\" href=\"http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/earthquakes\/tectonic\/images\/emaustralia_tsum.pdf\"><\/a>\n<p>\nThe eastern margin of the Australia plate is one of the most sesimically active \nareas of the world due to high rates of convergence between the Australia and \nPacific plates. In the region of New Zealand, the 3000 km long Australia-Pacific \nplate boundary extends from south of Macquarie Island to the southern Kermadec \nIsland chain. It includes an oceanic transform (the Macquarie Ridge), two \noppositely verging subduction zones (Puysegur and Hikurangi), and a transpressive \ncontinental transform, the Alpine Fault through South Island, New Zealand. \n<\/p>\n<p>\nSince 1900 there have been 15 M7.5+ earthquakes recorded near New \nZealand. Nine of these, and the four largest, occurred along or near the Macquarie \nRidge, including the 1989 M8.2 event on the ridge itself, and the 2004 M8.1 event \n200 km to the west of the plate boundary, reflecting intraplate deformation. \nThe largest recorded earthquake in New Zealand itself was the 1931 M7.8 Hawke's \nBay earthquake, which killed 256 people. The last M7.5+ earthquake along the \nAlpine Fault was 170 years ago; studies of the faults' strain accumulation suggest \nthat similar events are likely to occur again.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nNorth of New Zealand, the Australia-Pacific boundary stretches east of Tonga and \nFiji to 250 km south of Samoa. For 2,200 km the trench is approximately linear, \nand includes two segments where old (&gt;120 Myr) Pacific oceanic lithosphere rapidly \nsubducts westward (Kermadec and Tonga). At the northern end of the Tonga trench, \nthe boundary curves sharply westward and changes along a 700 km-long segment from \ntrench-normal subduction, to oblique subduction, to a left lateral transform-like \nstructure. \n<\/p>\n<p>\nAustralia-Pacific convergence rates increase northward from 60 mm\/yr at the southern \nKermadec trench to 90 mm\/yr at the northern Tonga trench; however, significant back \narc extension (or equivalently, slab rollback) causes the consumption rate of \nsubducting Pacific lithosphere to be much faster. The spreading rate in the Havre \ntrough, west of the Kermadec trench, increases northward from 8 to 20 mm\/yr. The \nsouthern tip of this spreading center is propagating into the North Island of New \nZealand, rifting it apart. In the southern Lau Basin, west of the Tonga trench, the \nspreading rate increases northward from 60 to 90 mm\/yr, and in the northern Lau \nBasin, multiple spreading centers result in an extension rate as high as 160 mm\/yr. \nThe overall subduction velocity of the Pacific plate is the vector sum of \nAustralia-Pacific velocity and back arc spreading velocity: thus it increases northward \nalong the Kermadec trench from 70 to 100 mm\/yr, and along the Tonga trench from 150 \nto 240 mm\/yr. \n<\/p>\n<p>The Kermadec-Tonga subduction zone generates many large earthquakes on the interface \nbetween the descending Pacific and overriding Australia plates, within the two plates \nthemselves and, less frequently, near the outer rise of the Pacific plate east of the \ntrench. Since 1900, 40 M7.5+ earthquakes have been recorded, mostly north of 30&deg;S. \nHowever, it is unclear whether any of the few historic M8+ events that have occurred \nclose to the plate boundary were underthrusting events on the plate interface, or were \nintraplate earthquakes. On September 29, 2009, one of the largest normal fault (outer rise) \nearthquakes ever recorded (M8.1) occurred south of Samoa, 40 km east of the Tonga trench, \ngenerating a tsunami that killed at least 180 people. \n<\/p>\n<p>\nAcross the North Fiji Basin and to the west of the Vanuatu Islands, the Australia plate \nagain subducts eastwards beneath the Pacific, at the North New Hebrides trench. At the \nsouthern end of this trench, east of the Loyalty Islands, the plate boundary curves east \ninto an oceanic transform-like structure analogous to the one north of Tonga.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nAustralia-Pacific convergence rates increase northward from 80 to 90 mm\/yr along the \nNorth New Hebrides trench, but the Australia plate consumption rate is increased by \nextension in the back arc and in the North Fiji Basin. Back arc spreading occurs at a \nrate of 50 mm\/yr along most of the subduction zone, except near ~15&deg;S, where the \nD'Entrecasteaux ridge intersects the trench and causes localized compression of 50 \nmm\/yr in the back arc. Therefore, the Australia plate subduction velocity ranges \nfrom 120 mm\/yr at the southern end of the North New Hebrides trench, to 40 mm\/yr \nat the D'Entrecasteaux ridge-trench intersection, to 170 mm\/yr at the northern \nend of the trench.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nLarge earthquakes are common along the North New Hebrides trench and have mechanisms \nassociated with subduction tectonics, though occasional strike slip earthquakes occur \nnear the subduction of the D'Entrecasteaux ridge. Within the subduction zone 34 M7.5+ \nearthquakes have been recorded since 1900. On October 7, 2009, a large interplate \nthrust fault earthquake (M7.6) in the northern North New Hebrides subduction zone \nwas followed 15 minutes later by an even larger interplate event (M7.8) 60 km to the \nnorth. It is likely that the first event triggered the second of the so-called \nearthquake &quot;doublet&quot;.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/of\/2010\/1083\/i\/\" target=\"_blank\"> More information on regional seismicity and tectonics<\/a>\n<\/p>","type":"neic"}},{"type":"Feature","id":52,"geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-116.9999999999,41.999999999801],[-120.000000000199,41.999999999801],[-125.000000000099,41.999999999801],[-125.000000000099,42.9999999996012],[-124.599999999999,44.5000000002008],[-125.000000000099,48.5000000003007],[-123.3999999997,48.2999999998011],[-123.2999999999,48.9500000003007],[-116.9999999999,49.0000000002008],[-116.9999999999,41.999999999801]]]},"properties":{"name":"Pacific Northwest","summary":"<h4>Earthquakes in the Pacific Northwest<\/h4>\n<p>\n  Earthquakes in the Pacific Northwest (PacNW) states of Washington and Oregon result from slip on faults in a variety of geographic and geologic settings. Earthquakes in much of the region are a consequence of stresses associated with motion of the Juan de Fuca Oceanic Plate to the northeast with respect to the North America Continental Plate at a rate of several cm per year. This relative motion is largely made possible because the Juan de Fuca plate descends into the Earth&apos;s mantle below the North American continent along what is called the Cascadia Subduction Zone, which extends from northwestern California through western Oregon and western Washington to Vancouver Island, Canada. Relative plate motion that is not accommodated by subduction of the Juan de Fuca plate is accommodated by deformation of the overriding North America plate. Earthquakes are associated with both the subduction process and the deformation of the overriding North America plate.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Seismological terms that are commonly used to describe the different modes of earthquake occurrence in Washington, Oregon, and the offshore continental slope include the following:\n<\/p>\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <b>&ldquo;Megathrust&rdquo; earthquakes<\/b>\n    (also called &ldquo;interplate&rdquo; or &ldquo;plate boundary&rdquo; quakes in the context of subduction zone seismicity) result from rupture of the principal interface between the subducting Juan de Fuca plate and the overriding North America plate. The last great megathrust earthquake in the Cascadia subduction zone was in 1700, a 1000&ndash;km long rupture that is documented by studies of the resulting tsunami in Japan, by Native American oral traditions, and by geologic deposits from tsunami and offshore turbidity flows caused by the intense shaking and ground deformation associated with the earthquake. Most of the megathrust interface between the Juan de Fuca plate and the North American plate has not been seismically active in the decades during which it has been monitored by seismometers, except perhaps near Cape Mendocino (where a Gorda microplate is commonly demarcated within the broader Juan de Fuca plate) and at one location offshore from Astoria, Oregon. However, geodetic data show that compressive tectonic strain is currently accumulating across the Cascadia Megathrust as a result of the subduction process. Together with geologic evidence for the 1700 and earlier great earthquakes, the accumulation of compressive tectonic&ndash;strain implies that the recent quiescence of most of the Cascadia Subduction Zone Megathrust is temporary and that the ongoing subduction process will cause large and great earthquakes in the future.\n  <\/li>\n  <li>\n    <b>&ldquo;Crustal&rdquo; earthquakes<\/b>\n    originate from slip on faults within the crust of the North American Plate. Some of these earthquakes reflect stresses that are generated by the convergence of the Juan de Fuca and North America plates but most are related to stresses originating from the interaction of the North American plate and the Pacific plate in California and Nevada. This interaction results in north&ndash;south oriented compressive stresses in the crust throughout the western and northern region. These crustal earthquakes occur in the upper 25 km of the earth&apos;s crust on faults oriented roughly east&ndash;west and northwest&ndash;southeast. In southern Oregon, extensional (pull apart) stresses also cause faulting and crustal earthquakes. Many crustal fault zones have been mapped, including the Seattle Fault Zone, the South Whidbey Island Fault, the Devil&apos;s Mountain Fault, the Tacoma Fault in the Puget Sound lowlands, and the Spencer Canyon Fault in central Washington. However, not all of the active faults are mapped, and many crustal earthquakes occur on faults that don&apos;t reach the Earth&apos;s surface. The largest historically documented crustal earthquake was the 1872 M&tilde;7 earthquake near Lake Chelan. Other crustal earthquakes have included the 1993 M5.6 Scott&apos;s Mills, Oregon, the 1993 M5.9 and M6.0 Klamath Falls, Oregon, and the 1996 M5.4 Duvall, Washington earthquakes.<\/p>\n  <\/li>\n  <li>\n    <b>&ldquo;Deep&rdquo; earthquakes<\/b>\n    (also sometimes called &ldquo;Benioff Zone&rdquo; or &ldquo;slab&rdquo; earthquakes) result from faulting within the down&ndash;going Juan de Fuca Plate. These earthquakes are caused by stresses within the subducting plate beneath the plate interface and are due to the deformation of the plate during its slow descent into the earth&apos;s mantle beneath the North America plate. Because these earthquakes occur at depth within the descending slab, their causative faults are not visible, and the faults are not mapped or named. Examples of mantle earthquakes include the 2001 M6.8 Nisqually earthquake and very similar earthquakes in 1949 and 1965. These earthquakes occurred in the 45 km &mdash; 70 km depth range. These PacNW &ldquo;deep&rdquo; earthquakes are not that deep compared to those in a global context called &ldquo;deep&rdquo;, a word often reserved for earthquakes occurring at depths greater than 300 km. Instrumentally recorded mantle earthquakes of the PacNW have had very few aftershocks.\n  <\/li>\n  <li>\n    <b>&ldquo;Volcanic&rdquo; earthquakes<\/b>\n    are located near volcanoes and are associated with volcanic processes. The category of volcanic earthquakes includes a variety of earthquake types. Seismograms of many volcanic earthquakes have characteristics that are very similar to those of non&ndash;volcanic crustal&ndash;earthquakes; these earthquakes are thought to result from the perturbation of the regional tectonic stress&ndash;field by the intrusion of magma and are denoted &ldquo;volcano tectonic&rdquo; earthquakes. Other volcanic earthquakes are characterized by signals that are much different than non&ndash;volcanic crustal&ndash;earthquakes and result from such processes as magmatic flow, bubbling and other processes within the liquid magma chamber, landslides caused by the shallow intrusion of lava, or the explosive violence of the eruption itself. During magmatic unrest at Mt. St. Helens in 1980 and 2004, hundreds of thousands of volcanic earthquakes took place.\n  <\/li>\n  <li>\n    <b>&ldquo;Swarm&rdquo;<\/b>\n    is a term used to describe the temporal distribution of events in a sequence of earthquakes, rather than a specific type or locale of earthquake. The term is used to denote a sequence of earthquakes in a small geographic area that are of similar size, in contrast to a &ldquo;main&ndash;shock\/aftershock sequence&rdquo;, in which a larger &ldquo;main&ndash;shock&rdquo;, perhaps preceded by a few smaller foreshocks, is followed by a sequence of numerous smaller shocks that occur at a generally decreasing rate with time. The term &ldquo;swarm&rdquo; may be applied to sequences that last for hours to years, with the largest earthquake in the sequence commonly occurring after the sequence has begun. The term &ldquo;swarm&rdquo; may be used for sequences consisting of dozens of earthquakes as well as for sequences that consist of thousands of shocks.

Fault","summary":"<h4>Hayward Fault<\/h4>\n<p>\nThe Hayward fault is a historically active, right&ndash;lateral, strike&ndash;slip that extends from San Pablo Bay to the Evergreen area east of San Jose, and closely follows the western front of the East Bay Hills. The Hayward fault runs through some of the most densely populated areas in California, making it a significant seismic hazard to both people and infrastructure. It is a part of the San Andreas Fault System, a group of both major and minor faults in western California that, at depth, compose the boundary between the North American and Pacific plates. The San Andreas Fault System accommodates the majority of the movement between the Pacific and North American plates, releasing accumulated stress and strain through earthquakes and aseismic creep.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe most recent major earthquake on the Hayward fault occurred on October 21st of 1868 and is estimated to have been between magnitude 6.8 and 7 and is thought to have caused 40 km of surface rupture on the southern part of the fault. Despite the relatively sparse population, it killed 30 people and caused significant damage throughout the Bay Area due to poor construction methods. The damage was concentrated in the East Bay, particularly near Hayward. Prior to the famous 1906 earthquake, the 1868 earthquake was known as the &lsquo;Great San Francisco Earthquake&rsquo;. This area has urbanized significantly in the ~150 years since that earthquake, increasing the risk associated with a potential repeat event. Geologic studies at Tule Pond (Fremont) on the southern segment of the Hayward Fault have shown that the average interval between the past 5 earthquakes has been 140 &plusmn; 50 years. The average interval of the past 11 earthquakes on this segment of the fault is 170 &plusmn; 80 years.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe Hayward Fault is an example of a creeping fault in the Bay area; some stress is released gradually by steady, small movements at the surface that are not usually associated with any earthquake activity. Much of the Hayward Fault near the ground surface experiences between 2.7 and 7.6 mm of creep each year (McFarland et. al., 2016). The highest creep rates on the Hayward fault are found on its southern portion near Fremont, CA.

Fault","summary":"<h4>Maacama Fault<\/h4>\n<p>\nThe Maacama Fault is mostly a right-lateral strike-slip fault that lies\n \n \nnorth of Santa Rosa and the immediate San Francisco Bay Area and extends as\n \nfar north as Ukiah.  It connects to the Rodgers Creek Fault through a\n \ncomplex set of faults between Santa Rosa and Healdsburg, and is thought to\n \nbe the northward continuation of the Hayward-Rodgers Creek Fault System.\n \nThe 2007 Working Group for California Earthquake Probability assigned a\n \ntotal slip rate on the Maacama Fault of approximately 9 mm\/yr (1\/3\n \ninches\/yr), based on the assumption that it continues the slip on the\n \nHayward-Rodgers Creek Fault northward.  The central and northern sections\n \nof the fault have been observed to accommodate approximately 7 mm\/yr (1\/4\n \ninch\/year) of creep along it.\n \n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe Maacama Fault parallels and overlaps the Rodgers Creek Fault, in a\n \ngeometry that is causing the ground between the faults to subside.\n \n<\/p>\n<p>\nIn Sonoma County north of Healdsburg, the Maacama Fault is largely obscured\n \nby massive landslides where it passes east of Alexander Valley.\n \n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe 2007 Working Group for California Earthquake Probability combined the\n \nMaacama and the Garberville

Fault","summary":"<h4>Calaveras Fault<\/h4>\n<p>\nThe Calaveras Fault is a mostly right-lateral, strike-slip fault.  The 2003\n \nWorking Group Report divided the fault into three segments. The northern\n \nsegment of the Calaveras Fault is virtually locked and this segment of the\n \nfault creeps at a rate between 2 and 3 mm\/yr.  At the southern end of its\n \ncentral stretch it creeps at about 14 mm\/yr dropping northward to about 6\n \nmm\/yr (0.24 inch\/yr) of creep at its intersection with the Hayward Fault.\n \n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe total slip rate on the Calaveras Fault is approximately 6 mm\/yr north\n \nof its intersection with the Hayward Fault and is approximately 15 mm\/yr to\n \nthe south.\n \n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe northern end of the central segment of the Calaveras Fault last\n \nproduced a notable earthquake in October 2007, the M5.4 Alum Rock\n \nearthquake, which ruptured to the south.\n \n<\/p>\n<p>\nHistorically, the southern half of the central segment of the Calaveras\n \nFault has been the most seismically active segment of the fault.  It\n \nproduced the M6.2 Morgan Hill earthquake in 1984 and a M6.2 earthquake in\n \n1911. The M5.9 Coyote Lake earthquake in 1979 ruptured slightly to the\n \nsouth of these other earthquakes.  Because its rate of creep nearly matches\n \nthe total fault slip rate, it is widely believed that this segment of the\n \nfault is not capable of an earthquake having a magnitude much larger than\n \nthe 1984 Morgan Hill earthquake.\n \n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe northern segment of the Calaveras Fault has little microseismicity,\n \nconsistent with its low creep rate of 2 to 3 mm\/yr and nearly locked\n \nbehavior.  The 2007 Working Group Report established a recurrence interval\n \nof surface rupturing earthquakes on this northern segment of 465 &plusmn; 130\n \nyears.

inch\/year) of creep.  The Concord\n \nFault lies to the south of the Green Valley Fault.  The total slip rate on\n \nthe Concord Fault segment is 4 mm\/yr (1\/6 inch\/year) and on the Green\n \nValley Fault segment is about 5 mm\/yr (1\/5 inches\/yr).\n \n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe Concord Fault maybe connected to the Greenville Fault through a complex\n \nset of faults under Mount Diablo, including the Mount Diablo Thrust.  The\n \nConcord Fault may also be connected to the northern Calaveras Fault through\n \na complex set of faults south of Walnut Creek.  The Green Valley Fault is a\n \ndirect continuation of the Concord Fault north of Carquinez Straight.  The\n \nnorthern end of the Green Valley Fault is not well defined at the surface\n \nor from seismicity.\n \n<\/p>\n<p>\nAt present, there is little information on the date of the last\n \nsurface-rupturing event on the Concord-Green Valley Fault.

Diablo Thrust Fault","summary":"<h4>Mount Diablo Thrust Fault<\/h4>\n<p>\nThe Mount Diablo Thrust is a fault deep in the crust that does not rupture\n \nto the surface but instead branches into a number of faults and folds in\n \nthe upper few kilometers of the crust.  This fault may accommodate the\n \ntransfer of slip from the Greenville Fault to the Concord Fault, and is\n \nthought to be responsible for the ongoing uplift of Mount Diablo.\n \n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe total slip rate for the fault, approximately 3 to 4 mm\/yr (1\/8\n \ninch\/year), represents long-term averages derived from balanced cross\n \nsections and analysis of stratigraphic relations to determine when the\n \nshortening of the Mount Diablo region began.\n \n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe thrust fault appears to result from a restraining transfer of slip on\n \nthe Greenville Fault to the slip on

Creek Fault","summary":"<h4>Rodgers Creek Fault<\/h4>\n<p>\nThe Rodgers Creek Fault is a potentially right-lateral strike-slip fault.\n \nThe creep rate along the fault is not well characterized, but the fault may\n \nbe mostly locked with up to 6 mm\/yr of creep in places along the northern\n \nhalf of the fault.  The total slip rate on the Rodgers Creek Fault is about\n \n9 mm\/yr (0.35 inches\/yr).\n \n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe two most recent moderate sized (M5.6 and 5.7) earthquakes on the\n \nRodgers Creek Fault struck near Santa Rosa in October 1969.  An 1893\n \nearthquake near Santa Rosa and an 1898 earthquake near Mare Island are\n \nthought to have occurred along or near the Rodgers Creek Fault.\n \n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe most recent large, surface rupturing Rodgers Creek Fault occurred\n \nbetween AD 1690 and 1824 (and probably between AD 1715 and 1776). The\n \nelapsed time from the last large, surface rupturing earthquake is thus at\n \nleast 183 years and more likely at least 231 years.  The 2003 Working Group\n \nfor California Earthquake Probability estimated the recurrence interval\n \nbetween large earthquakes on this fault as between 200 and 300 years.\n \n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe Rodgers Creek and Hayward Faults are parallel faults that overlap each\n \nother in San Pablo Bay, where they are separated by a distance of about 5\n \nkm (3 miles).  Given the distance between these parallel faults, the 2003\n \nWorking Group for California Earthquake Probability considered scenarios in\n \nwhich both the Rodgers Creek and Hayward Faults ruptured

The fault in the San Francisco Bay region is a largely\n \nstrike-slip fault running through the Santa Cruz Mountains, the Gulf of the\n \nFarallons west of the Golden Gate, through Tomales Bay and Bodega Bay, and\n \nnorth to Fort Ross and Point Arena.  Northward of Point Arena, the location\n \nand character of the San Andreas Fault is less well known.   The fault in\n \nthis region is locked, exhibiting no creep at the surface and generating\n \nvery few microearthquakes that are associated with minor slipping at depth.\n \nThrough the San Francisco Bay Area, the slip rate on the San Andreas Fault\n \nis about 20 mm\/yr (4\/5 inch\/year).\n \n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe October 17, 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake was the most recent major\n \nearthquake associated with the San Andreas Fault. While the earthquake was\n \nnot produced by the main San Andreas Fault, it occurred on a closely\n \nassociated blind thrust fault that had formed as a result of a bend in the\n \nSan Andreas Fault, south of the bay.  Although that earthquake struck along\n \na remote segment of the Santa Cruz Mountains, 64 deaths resulted, most from\n \nthe collapse of the Cypress Freeway in Oakland.  About 16,000 homes and\n \napartment units were uninhabitable after the earthquake.  The San\n \nFrancisco-Oakland Bay Bridge was closed for more than a month because of a\n \ncollapse of a section of its eastern span.\n \n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe left bend in the San Andreas Fault in the Santa Cruz Mountains favors\n \nthickening of the crust and uplift of the Earth's surface, and is thought\n \nto be responsible to the formation of the Santa Cruz Mountains.\n \n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe M7.9 April 18, 1906 San Francisco earthquake was the most recent great\n \nearthquake on the San Andreas Fault and it ruptured from approximately Cape\n \nMendocino south to San Juan Bautista.  The 1906 earthquake was the largest\n \nearthquake to strike Northern California in historic times, and is thought\n \nto have killed more than 3,000 Bay Area residents.  The epicenter of that\n \nearthquake is now estimated to be offshore about 2 miles west of San\n \nFrancisco. The fire following the 1906 earthquake burned 5 square miles of\n \nSan Francisco and resulted in 225,000 homeless refugees of the earthquake.\n \n<\/p>\n<p>\nA large (magnitude 6.8) earthquake in 1838 is often assumed to have\n \noccurred on the Peninsula segment of the San Andreas Fault.  To date,\n \nhowever, unambiguous observations placing that earthquake on the San\n \nAndreas Fault have not been found.\n \n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe 2003 Working Group for California Earthquake Probability

It largely lies offshore the San\n \nFrancisco peninsula and has a limited on-land exposure along the San Mateo\n \nCounty coast.  The fault merges with the San Andreas Fault near Bolinas,\n \nnorth of the Golden Gate.\n \n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe 2003 Working Group for California Earthquake Probability estimated that\n \nthe slip rate on the San Gregorio Fault is approximately 7 mm\/yr (1\/4\n \ninches\/yr).\n \n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe last large, surface rupturing earthquake on the San Gregorio Fault is\n \ndated between 1270 and 1776 AD.

Valley - Coast Range Boundary Thrust Faults","summary":"<h4>Great Valley - Coast Range Boundary Thrust Faults<\/h4>\n<p>\nA series of thrust faults probably underlie the boundary between the\n \neastern Coast Ranges and the Great Valley along the entire length of the\n \nGreat Valley.  In the San Francisco Bay area, these faults would be located\n \nin the subsurface in the vicinity of Vacaville, Fairfield, Pittsburg, and\n \nTracy.  These faults angle down and westward, and produce the uplift of the\n \nhills along this boundary.  There is very little known about the seismic\n \nhistory or earthquake cycle of this fault system in the San Francisco Bay\n \nregion.

Southern Utah","summary":"<h4>Earthquakes in the Intermountain Seismic Belt (Southern Utah and Vicinity)<\/h4>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Intermountain seismic belt (ISB) is a prominent north-south-trending zone \r\nof recorded seismicity in the Intermountain West.  \r\nA modern catalog of instrumentally located earthquakes in Utah begins in mid-1962, \r\nand historical earthquake records date back to the 1850s.  \r\nThe ISB in southern Utah is characterized by scattered seismicity \r\nwith locally dense clusters of small- to moderate-sized earthquakes.  \r\nThe largest earthquake in the ISB in southern Utah was a M6.5 earthquake in 1901 in Richfield.  \r\nA group of three M5 and 6 earthquakes occurred in Elsinore in the Sevier Valley in 1921.  \r\nTo the south in southwestern Utah, a damaging earthquake (M5.9) occurred in 1992 near St. George.  \r\nEarthquake swarms (clusters of earthquakes with no outstanding main shocks) \r\nof maximum magnitude 3 to 4 are common in the area.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nBecause moderate and large earthquakes are likely, expected levels of strong ground shaking are relatively high.  \r\nGround shaking from a M5 earthquake can cause significant damage at distances up to 10 km (6 miles), \r\nand a M7 at distances up to 50 km (30 miles) and more.  \r\nGeologic site conditions such as deep sediment-filled basins may locally amplify and prolong ground shaking.  \r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Faults<\/h4>\r\n<p>\r\nThe ISB in southern Utah coincides with a transition between east-west-directed stretching in the Basin \r\nand Range to the west and more stable crust of the Colorado Plateau to the east.  \r\nTectonic movement on generally north-trending, east- and west-dipping range- and plateau-bounding normal faults, \r\nwhich results in horizontal extension, characterizes this part of Utah.  \r\nThe Sevier Valley is an area of variable and complex deformation involving significant components \r\nof folding and both normal and strike-slip faulting.  \r\nThe most prominent geologically young faults in southwestern Utah are the Hurricane and Sevier faults.  \r\nThe Hurricane fault forms the west-facing Hurricane Cliffs, which define the eastern edge \r\nof the Basin and Range within the ISB.  Faults in the ISB in southern Utah locally show evidence \r\nof displacement younger than 10,000 years, \r\nbut average recurrence intervals are generally longer than those on faults in the ISB in northern Utah.  \r\nRecurrence intervals for surface faulting on the most active segments of ISB faults \r\nin southern Utah are generally many thousand to tens of thousands of

Basin and Range","summary":"<h4>Earthquakes in the Eastern Basin and Range<\/h4>\n<p>\nThe eastern Basin and Range (eastern Great Basin) in western Utah is an area \nof low seismicity, and the widely distributed historical earthquakes have generally been small (M2-3).  \nRegional network instrumentation in the area is sparse, \nbut the record is complete for earthquakes larger than M2 since at least 1981.  \nHistorical surface-faulting earthquakes (M6.5 and greater) have occurred \nin the Basin and Range in Nevada, but none have occurred in Utah west \nof the Intermountain seismic belt (ISB).  \nEarthquakes larger than M3 are rare, and only a few larger \nthan M4 have occurred; the largest are three M4.7 earthquakes (1970, 1987, and 1992) west \nof the Great Salt Lake in northwestern Utah and a 1937 M5.4 earthquake in southern Idaho.  \nIn 2008, a M6.0 earthquake occurred in the Basin and Range near Wells, Nevada, 75 km (47 mi) west of the Utah border.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nBecause rates of seismicity are low, expected levels of strong ground shaking are also low.  \nHowever, a potential exists for large earthquakes, as shown by the presence of geologically young faulting.  \nGround shaking in a M5 earthquake can cause significant damage at distances up to 10 km (6 miles), \nand a M7 at distances up to 50 km (30 miles) and more.  \nGeologic site conditions such as deep sediment-filled basins may locally amplify and prolong ground shaking. \n<\/p>\n\n<h4>Faults<\/h4>\n<p>\nThe Basin and Range is a zone of east-west-directed stretching \nnear the western edge of the North American tectonic plate.  \nStretching is accommodated by movement along north-trending, east- and west-dipping range-front normal faults, \nresulting in horizontal extension and formation of alternating uplifted mountain ranges and down-dropped basins.  \nThe age of most recent faulting on most eastern Basin and Range faults is older \nand, thus, faults are less active than many geologically young faults \nin the neighboring ISB to the east.  \nAlso, the distribution of faults is less dense compared to adjacent areas \nin Utah and Nevada, perhaps in part because relatively thick latest Pleistocene Lake Bonneville deposits \nbury some older faults.  \nMany eastern Basin and Range faults are inferred to be moderate- to high-angle structures extending \nto depths of 10-15 km (6-10 miles) capable of causing large earthquakes and strong ground shaking.  \nHowever, some of the younger normal faults west and south of Delta, Utah \n(between about 38.5 to 40&deg;N latitude), are likely a result of down-dip movement \non underlying shallow, low-angle, west-dipping thrust faults inherited from earlier tectonic regimes.  \nThe potential for movement on these faults to cause strong ground shaking is less well understood but likely low.  \n<\/p>\n<p>\nLarge historical Basin and Range earthquakes in Nevada have ruptured \nto

in mid-1962, \r\nand historical earthquake records date back to the 1850s.  \r\nIn general, M5 or larger earthquakes occur at an average rate of about one every 10 years \r\nand M6 or larger earthquakes about one every 50 years in this area.  \r\nThe largest historical earthquake was the 1934 M6.6 surface-faulting earthquake \r\nin Hansel Valley, north of the Great Salt Lake.  \r\nThe ISB in northern Utah includes the Wasatch fault, \r\nwhich has had relatively little historical seismicity despite \r\nbeing Utah's most active fault based on geological evidence.  \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nBecause moderate and large earthquakes are likely, \r\nexpected levels of strong ground shaking are high.  Ground shaking \r\nfrom a M5 earthquake can cause significant damage \r\nat distances up to 10 km (6 miles), and a M7 at distances up to 50 km (30 miles) and more.  \r\nGeologic site conditions such as deep sediment-filled basins may locally amplify and prolong ground shaking.  \r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Faults<\/h4>\r\n<p>\r\nThe ISB in northern Utah coincides with a transition between east-west-directed stretching \r\nin the Basin and Range to the west and an area of more stable crust of the Middle Rocky Mountains to the east.  \r\nThe area is characterized by movement along north-trending, east- and west-dipping range-bounding normal faults, \r\nresulting in horizontal extension.  \r\nThe ISB in northern Utah contains the Wasatch fault and many of the state's other most active faults, \r\nwhich commonly show evidence of multiple displacements in the past 10,000 years.  \r\nAverage recurrence intervals for large surface-faulting earthquakes on the most active central segments \r\nof the Wasatch fault are 1,300-2,500 years; recurrence intervals are typically longer \r\n(thousands to 10,000 years or more) on other faults in the area.  \r\nISB faults are inferred to be moderate- to high-angle structures extending \r\nto depths of 10-15 km (6-10 miles) and capable of causing large earthquakes and strong ground shaking.  \r\nHowever, evidence suggests that some normal faults are gently dipping \r\nwith down-dip movement on underlying shallow, low-angle, west-dipping thrust faults formed \r\nduring an earlier Cretaceous\/early Tertiary period of east-directed compression.  \r\nThe potential for movement on these faults to cause strong ground shaking is less well understood but likely low. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nSurface rupture on the Hansel Valley fault occurred during the 1934 Hansel Valley earthquake.  \r\nHowever, most small- to moderate-sized earthquakes in the ISB cannot be associated \r\nwith recognized geologically young faults.  \r\nPart of the problem of associating seismicity with faults arises \r\nfrom the superposition of late Cenozoic stretching upon older thrust-belt structure, \r\nincluding buried faults having no surface expression.\r\n<\/p>","type":"ut"}},{"type":"Feature","id":30,"geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-110.76418845893,39.8336457040868],[-110.70118845848,39.8333457037421],[-110.598888458735,39.8333457037421],[-110.4999884584,39.8333457037421],[-110.42698845815,39.7785457037222],[-110.3739884584,39.7388457039669],[-110.311588459539,39.6920457041468],[-110.233288458595,39.6333457041418],[-110.21378845867,39.5551457042118],[-110.201488458925,39.5059457043317],[-110.18638845866,39.4457457035023],[-110.166688458505,39.3667457035523],[-110.258488458775,39.3667457035523],[-110.34318845898,39.3667457035523],[-110.437488459424,39.3667457035523],[-110.516688458705,39.3667457035523],[-110.528688459005,39.4209457037821],[-110.540788459419,39.4754457043567],[-110.5499884583,39.5167457041518],[-110.5879884588,39.5420457044466],[-110.61858845889,39.5624457045066],[-110.649988459,39.5833457042418],[-110.72358845904,39.5833457042418],[-110.753488458325,39.5833457042418],[-110.789088458765,39.5833457042418],[-110.87058845889,39.5833457042418],[-110.949988459299,39.5833457042418],[-110.949988459299,39.4976457037871],[-110.949988459299,39.4193457046414],[-110.949988459299,39.3714457044566],[-110.949988459299,39.3170457039969],[-110.949988459299,39.2243457044916],[-110.949988459299,39.166745703952],[-111.04318845848,39.166745703952],[-111.097088459264,39.166745703952],[-111.121488458525,39.166745703952],[-111.20938845881,39.166745703952],[-111.299988459499,39.166745703952],[-111.299988459499,39.2115457041718],[-111.299988459499,39.2563457034923],[-111.299988459499,39.3074457046565],[-111.299988459499,39.3586457041368],[-111.299988459499,39.4113457044416],[-111.299988459499,39.4513457045416],[-111.299988459499,39.500845703867],[-111.299988459499,39.542345703892],[-111.299988459499,39.5833457042418],[-111.33818845843,39.6119457047314],[-111.366688458805,39.6333457041418],[-111.366688458805,39.6798457036172],[-111.366688458805,39.7197457045016],[-111.366688458805,39.7500457042468],[-111.328888459434,39.7736457043866],[-111.287488458625,39.7994457034574],[-111.2619884581,39.8154457038571],[-111.233288459294,39.8333457037421],[-111.16138845851,39.8333457037421],[-111.086288458545,39.8333457037421],[-110.99038845896,39.8333457037421],[-110.881788459169,39.8333457037421],[-110.800288459045,39.8333457037421],[-110.78638845836,39.8333457037421],[-110.76418845893,39.8336457040868]]],[[[-111.43578845907,38.9033457043417],[-111.483288458795,38.9033457043417],[-111.483288458795,38.9181457042617],[-111.483288458795,38.9362457043766],[-111.483288458795,38.9673457041418],[-111.483288458795,39.0015457047713],[-111.483288458795,39.0333457035423],[-111.455488458325,39.0333457035423],[-111.427288459194,39.0333457035423],[-111.403888459284,39.0333457035423],[-111.37778845897,39.0333457035423],[-111.35518845908,39.0333457035423],[-111.32618845903,39.0333457035423],[-111.29838845856,39.0333457035423],[-111.266688459005,39.0333457035423],[-111.266688459005,39.0019457043317],[-111.266688459005,38.9797457040019],[-111.266688459005,38.9608457038671],[-111.266688459005,38.9318457038171],[-111.266688459005,38.9033457043417],[-111.32058845889,38.9033457043417],[-111.349188459379,38.9033457043417],[-111.37938845901,38.9033457043417],[-111.41278845872,38.9033457043417],[-111.43578845907,38.9033457043417]]]]},"properties":{"name":"Utah Coal Mining","summary":"<h4>Earthquakes in the Area of Coal-Mining-Induced Seismicity<\/h4>\n<p>\nAreas of underground coal mining in central Utah are the sites of mining-induced earthquakes caused \nby rockbursts and collapses in the mines, extensional subsidence above mine workings, \nand stress relief along pre-existing faults in the rock mass immediately surrounding the mine workings.  \nEarthquakes coincide with the locations of active mines along the eastern Wasatch Plateau \nand western Book Cliffs.

from 1979-1987.  \nThe most seismically active area is near the Cane Creek potash mine west of Moab; \nthe two largest earthquakes in this area of mining-induced seismicity were M3.3 and 3.0 in 1984.  \nDamaging earthquakes are rare in the western Paradox Basin. \nThe largest historical earthquakes were a M4.4 in 2000 near the Paradox Valley \nin western Colorado and a M4.3 in 1953 near Green River, Utah.  \nThe M4.4 earthquake in 2000 and many smaller earthquakes in the Paradox Valley were induced \nby brine injection in deep wells.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nBecause moderate and large earthquakes are rare, expected levels of strong ground shaking are low.  \nHowever, bedrock at the ground surface over much of the Paradox Basin causes ground shaking \nto be felt over a much larger area than for a similar magnitude earthquake in western Utah. \n<\/p>\n\n<h4>Faults<\/h4>\n<p>\nThe Paradox Basin is the area underlain by thick beds of salt in the Pennsylvanian-age Paradox Formation.  \nIn contrast to most of the Colorado Plateau, the Paradox Basin is structurally complex resulting \nfrom movement and dissolution of Paradox Formation salt.  \nThe northern part of the area around Moab is a fold and fault belt characterized \nby northwest-trending faults with evidence for geologically young displacement.  \nThese high-angle, valley-bounding faults are associated with collapse due \nto salt dissolution along the crests of large salt anticlines, \ncored by mobilized upwelling plumes of salt from the underlying Paradox Formation.  \nStudies of small earthquakes in the area indicate the tectonic setting is one of northeast-directed stretching.  \n<\/p>\n<p>\nEarthquakes in the area generally do not coincide with mapped faults, and many are mining-induced.  \nAlthough the salt anticlines and faults are favorably oriented with respect \nto the modern tectonic stresses, geologically young faulting is due \nto dissolution-related collapse or remobilization of salt, \nwhich likely does not cause moderate or large earthquakes and strong ground shaking.  \nHowever, the deeper-seated Moab fault extends below the Paradox Formation and may experience tectonic displacements.\n<\/p>","type":"ut"}},{"type":"Feature","id":17,"geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-110.299896240518,42.5038986201261],[-110.063201904044,42.5043983455082],[-109.699699401705,42.5037002566624],[-109.350601195788,42.5031013486492],[-108.751197815326,42.4995994569503],[-108.751197815326,40.3014984131221],[-108.765197754073,40.298801421849],[-108.790603637847,40.293800354004],[-108.902496338035,40.2817001341548],[-108.910499573096,40.2807006833907],[-109.013198852944,40.2909011843431],[-109.076896667946,40.3050994874523],[-109.111801147105,40.3154983518684],[-109.148002624021,40.3263015748587],[-109.158203124974,40.33890152009],[-109.185997010053,40.3734016424727],[-109.153701782511,40.3933982849038],[-109.145401001355,40.3983993527488],[-109.117698669058,40.4155006413424],[-109.083198547574,40.4594001764779],[-109.149597167874,40.5098991391349],[-109.221603393881,40.5108985898989],[-109.280097960852,40.5116996762999],[-109.371597289882,40.5013008118839],[-109.403396606068,40.4976005558219],[-109.438201904394,40.4938011162294],[-109.446701049014,40.4928016663647],[-109.464103698626,40.4906005855495],[-109.479103088136,40.4866981510997],[-109.56069946231,40.4655990603492],[-109.58010101345,40.4639015198402],[-109.656700134703,40.4569015504671],[-109.668502807558,40.458301543982],[-109.766197204637,40.4696998591621],[-109.795898437562,40.4729995724732],[-109.803398132317,40.4757995613016],[-109.85220336849,40.4933013908474],[-109.912498474424,40.5354003906164],[-110.043197631765,40.5369987484943],[-110.105300902914,40.5289001466253],[-110.131599426772,40.5255012515824],[-110.159896850359,40.5171012877951],[-110.204902648738,40.5037002561628],[-110.211601257092,40.5018005372659],[-110.27220153807,40.4837989805394],[-110.406898498466,40.4617004390249],[-110.505897521353,40.4379005438759],[-110.51789855947,40.4304008482215],[-110.552398680954,40.4087982180642],[-110.556098937915,40.4065017704413],[-110.721099853275,40.3745002749686],[-110.750198364163,40.3630981448644],[-110.801696777584,40.342498779496],[-110.819999695329,40.342498779496],[-110.828102112122,40.3427009587831],[-110.534896850509,41.18809890674],[-110.476997374828,41.4384994507899],[-110.443496704109,41.5861015323607],[-110.421401977519,41.6800994874023],[-110.41359710682,41.713298798002],[-110.39859771731,41.7769012452972],[-110.37139892532,41.891399383076],[-110.370796203282,41.8939018249102],[-110.358901977644,41.9440994256489],[-110.350997925214,41.9772987362486],[-110.349800109187,41.9892005917348],[-110.337997436332,42.1132011416203],[-110.333900451544,42.155799865872],[-110.323699950592,42.2608985908981],[-110.319099426397,42.3084983829949],[-110.318496704359,42.3149986260866],[-110.300201415562,42.5001983640641],[-110.299896240518,42.5038986201261]]]},"properties":{"name":"Middle Rocky Mountains - Wyoming Basin","summary":"<h4>Earthquakes in the Middle Rocky Mountains and Wyoming Basin<\/h4>\n<p>\nFew earthquakes are recorded east of the Intermountain seismic belt \nin the Uinta Mountains and adjacent Wyoming Basin.  \nThe area is peripheral to the regional seismograph network, so recording \nof small earthquakes may be incomplete.  \nInstrumentally recorded tectonic earthquakes in the area have generally been small (M2-4).  \nEarthquakes associated with trona (sodium carbonate) mining occur \nin southwestern Wyoming and also are typically small, although the largest earthquake \nin the area (M5.2) was associated with collapse in a trona mine near Little America, Wyoming, in 1995.  \nThe largest earthquake in the Uinta Mountains was M4.5 in 1975 \nnear

Colorado Plateau","summary":"<h4>Earthquakes in the Western Colorado Plateau<\/h4>\n<p>\nThe western Colorado Plateau in southeastern Utah is an area of low seismicity, \nand historical earthquakes have generally been small (M2-4) and widely distributed.  \nThe highest concentration of seismicity is related to underground coal mining \nalong the northwestern edge of the western Colorado Plateau.  \nRegional network instrumentation in the Colorado Plateau outside the coal-mining area is sparse, \nso the record, particularly for smaller earthquakes, may be incomplete. \nAnother part of the Colorado Plateau where induced seismicity has occurred \nis the Rangely oil field in northwestern Colorado, close to the Utah border, \nwhere earthquakes as large as M4.5 were triggered in the 1960s by fluid injection. \nThe largest historical earthquake in the Colorado Plateau in Utah \nwas the 1988 M5.2 San Rafael Swell earthquake near Castle Dale south of Price.  \nHowever, larger earthquakes (M5-6) have occurred in northern Arizona.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nBecause moderate and large earthquakes are rare, expected levels of strong ground shaking are relatively low.  \nHowever, the stable, undeformed bedrock at the ground surface over much \nof the Colorado Plateau causes ground shaking to be felt and damage to occur \nover a much larger area than for a similar magnitude earthquake in western Utah.  \nGround shaking from the M5.2 San Rafael Swell earthquake near Castle Dale was felt \nas far away as Golden, Colorado (475 km, 295 miles) to the east, \nbut only as far as Delta, Utah (156 km, 97 miles) to the west in the Basin and Range. \n<\/p>\n<h4>Faults<\/h4>\n<p>\nThe Colorado Plateau is a large, stable block of the North American tectonic plate \nthat extends across much of eastern Utah and western Colorado and is characterized \nby generally flat-lying and locally folded sedimentary rocks.  \nIt was uplifted relative to adjacent areas during Cenozoic time, \nbut is relatively unaffected by faulting in the past 2 million years.  \nThe most recent movement on geologically young faults in the area is generally greater \nthan 150,000 years and little evidence exists for younger movement.  \nAlthough the predominant mode of deformation in the western Colorado Plateau \nis faulting on northwest-trending faults in response to approximate northeast-southwest stretching, \ndata from the 1988 San Rafael Swell earthquake implies a response \nto stretching in a roughly east-west direction, similar to the tectonic stresses \nin the nearby Basin and Range and Intermountain seismic belt to the west.  \n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe few moderate-magnitude earthquakes in the area have not been attributable \nto mapped geologically young faults, and most earthquakes likely \noccur along deeply buried pre-existing faults lacking surficial expression.\n<\/p>","type":"ut"}}]}}
